GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON COINAGES FOR THE CHANNEL ISLANDS
Before treating of the Channel Islands coinages in detail it may be of
interest briefly to notice in order the various changes and the
influences which led to these
The earliest inhabitants of the islands of whom anything is known were
contemporaneous with the ancient Britons of Druidical times Jersey and
Guernsey are still rich in Druidical remains The Tablestone of the
Cromlech at Gorey is 160 feet superficial and the weight as I have
made it after careful calculation is about 2334 tons It rests on
six upright stones weighing on an average one ton each In the very
complete work recently edited by E Toulmin NicolleA is the following
interesting note
That traces of the old Northmen which were once obscure have now
become clear and patent that institutions long deemed Roman may be
Scandinavian that in blood and language there are many more foreign
elements than were originally recognized are the results of much
wellapplied learning and acumen But no approximation to the proportion
that these foreign elements bear to the remainder has been obtained
neither has the analysis of them gone much beyond the discovery of
those which are referred to Scandinavia Of the tribes on the mainland
those which in the time of Csar and in the first four centuries of our
era have the best claim to be considered as the remote ancestors of the
early occupants of the islanders are the Curiosilites the Rhedones
the Osismii the Lemovices the Veneti and the Unelliall mentioned by
Csar himself as well as by writers who came after him A little later
appear the names of the Abrincatui and the Bajucasses All these are
referable to some part of either Normandy or Brittany and all seem to
have been populations allied to each other in habits and politics They
all belonged to the tract which bore the name of Armorica a word which
in the Keltic means the same as Pomerania in Sclavonicie the
country along the seaside

All evidences that can be gathered would tend to prove that before the
time of the Romans the Channel Islands were but thinly populated There
are no traces of decayed large towns nor records of pirate strongholds
and the conclusion is that the inhabitants were fishermen and some
living by hunting and crude tillage The frequent Druidical remains show
the religion which obtained Any coins in use in those days would be
Gaulish of the types then circulated amongst the mainland tribes above
named
The writer of the foregoing notes considers that the earliest history of
the Channel Islands is as follows page 284
1 At first the occupants were Bretonsfew in numberpagan and
probably poor fishermen
2 Under the Romans a slight infusion of either Roman or Legionary
blood may have taken placemore in Alderney than in Jerseymore in
Jersey than in Sark
3 When the Litus Saxonicum was established there may have been
thereon lighthouses for the honest sailor or small piratical holdings
for the corsair as the case might be There were however no emporia
or places either rich through the arts of peace or formidable for the
mechanism of war
4 When the Irish Church under the school of St Columbanus was in
its full missionary vigour Irish missionaries preached the Gospel to
the islanders and amongst the missionaries and the islanders there may
have been a few Saxons of the Litus
5 In the sixth century some portion of that mixture of Saxons Danes
Chattuarii Leti Goths Bretons and Romanized Gauls whom the Frank
kings drove to the coasts may have betaken themselves to the islands
opposite
To summarisethe elements of the population nearest the Channel
Islands were1 original Keltic 2 Roman 3 Legionary 4 Saxon
5 Gothic 6 Letic 7 Frank 8 Vandalall earlier than the time
of Rollo and most of them German to which we may add as a possible
element the Alans of Brittany
That the soldiers of the Roman garrison were not necessarily Roman is
suggested by the word Legionary Some of them are particularly stated
to have been foreign There is indeed special mention of the troop of
cavalry from DalmatiaEquites Dalmat
The inference from the above as regards coins current in the Channel
Islands prior to the Norman conquest of England would clearly be that
subsequent to the circulation of the first uninscribed Gaulish coins as
imitated from the Phillippus types there followed the wellstruck Roman
issues which in course of time were superseded by the coinages used
and introduced by later invaders and settlers
Britishstruck coins of the Saxon kings are rarely found in the Channel
Islands the coins used at the Saxon period of England being doubtless
drawn by these islands from Normandy and Brittany There have never so
far as is known been regal or state mints established in the Channel
Islands with the exception of the strange venture by Colonel Smyth in
the reign of King Charles I which will be fully noted in turn
hereafter
Freluques and enseignes also perhaps appear to have been struck in
Guernsey and a few copper tokens as will be described were introduced
by banks and firms But from the time of the Romans until the present
century French and other foreign money has been imported and formed
the recognized currency
THE EARLIEST COINS OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS
As referred to in the preceding general notes the earliest coins known
to have been in use in the Channel Islands are of the same types as used
at the time on the near coast of France They are styled Gaulish and
are generally of the following description
O Sinister head in profile nose lips eyes and ears expressed by
duplicate lines tracery or ornamentation in front of the face and
profuse rolls of curling hair
R Figure of a horse extravagantly drawn and decorated and with
ornaments or gear of some kind above and below Often the mane of the
horse is arranged and curled as if specially so dressed for parade or
show and almost suggests decorations as still sometimes adopted by
American Indian or other barbarian chiefs There are reins too in some
instances and these are sometimes held by a rough representation of an
arm and hand The legs of the horse always indicate gallopping The
symbols underneath it are usually either 1 the wild boar as perhaps
indicative of the most important local wild beast in the chase 2 the
chariot wheel as representing that the horse would draw this vehicle
there not being room to show the whole on the coin fully and in rear of
the horse 3 the implement described by Sir John EvansB as a
lyreshaped object It would be most interesting to ascertain what
this instrumentwhich is frequently delineatedmay really be It might
be a musical production of the bagpipe character or a headdress or a
warlike weapon An extensive museum or collection of very ancient
implements should solve the problem
B The Coins of the Ancient Britons By Sir John Evans KCB
FSA FGS Published by J Russell Smith 36 Soho Square London
As regards the metal of which the coins are made Sir John Evans at
page 128 of his work states as follows
These coins are formed of billon or base silver which appears to
vary considerably in the amount of its alloy From an analysis made by
De Caylus Donop Medailles Gallo Gaeliques page 24 of two coins
their compositions were found to be as follows
A            B
Silver         0413         1770
Copper         8414         7954
Tin            1166         0265
Iron           0005         0009
Gold           0002         0002
10000        10000
The weight of the larger pieces ranges from 80 to 105 grains and that
of the smaller coins is about 25 grains
It will be observed from the above analysis how considerably the
proportions of the white metals as silver and tin vary in these coins
and this variation as regards metallic composition is so universal
that amongst a large number in the same find you will even on
cleaning the coins see some of them look as if made of silver and the
colour vary until you reach some that appear hardly better than wholly
of copper It would be very interesting to know where the metal or ore
for these coinages was procured from There must have been a natural
mixture of most of the metals
I have looked through a find of more than 200 Jersey Gaulish coins
which are in the possession of R R Lempriere Esq They were turned up
by the plough on his manor of Rozel and whatever covering had enclosed
them had either gone to decay or become broken up as they were quite
loose He had cleaned a few of them Even to the eye the metallic
composition varied greatlysome being of the colour of silver and some
lowering to that of copper In this lot there were but two of the
smaller size of 25 grains and I think that proportion may perhaps give
some indication as to the relative rarity of the two coins for at a
rough estimate one seems to meet only about one in a hundred which is
of the smaller kind The larger Gaulish coins are common large finds
of the types formerly used in the Channel Islands having been made on
the adjacent mainland of Normandy and Brittany and also on the south
coast of England
Sir John Evans mentions page 128 the hoard at Mount Batten near
Plymouth Numismatic Journal Vol I page 224 and that in the
Arch Assoc Journal Vol III page 62 is an account of a find of
them at Avranches written by Mr C Roach Smith also in 1820 nearly
1000 were discovered in Jersey and previously in 1787 there had been
a find in that island The manor of Rozel seems to have been most rich
in furnishing specimens In addition to the number in possession of the
seigneur of Rozel as before referred to there are from that district
of the island collections at the St Helier Museum and with Lady
Marett Wm Nicolle Esq Dr Le Cronier E C Cable Esq and
others
They are often turned up in agricultural work and many farmers possess
a few but will not part with them nor with their stone or bronze
spearheads arrowheads axeheads and jars as there is often some
superstition that it is unlucky to let these be sold away from the
neighbourhood where they were dug up
Full descriptions of some finds are given in the annual issues of the
Societe Jersiaise together with illustrations The illustrations
differ little as regards the types shown from those given in the works
of Evans and Hawkins There is however one point to be observed that
is interesting and noteworthyie Gaulish and Roman coins have been
found enclosed together in the same urn thus indicating that the two
coinages had concurrently come into the possession of the same person
before being hidden This appears proof of concurrent circulation The
small urn found by Mr George Amy of Rozel close to the spot where the
landslip occurred in 1875 is in the Jersey Museum It is of course
handmade pottery and burnt nearly black It contained both Gaulish and
Roman coinsthe former both of billon and silver being mainly of
the smaller or more rare sort and each weighing only from 18 to 28
grains The urn was a small one the top having been covered by a flat
stone with a larger stone keeping this down in its place
By consideration of the metal values of Gaulish and Roman coins turned
up in the same find we might arrive at the relative current values as
regulated and assigned at the period
ROMAN COINS IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS
After conquest and occupation by the Romans the Gaulish currency as
well as that of ancient Britain was superseded by Roman issues Mr
Edward Hawkins in his standard work on the Silver Coins of EnglandC
page 22 tersely and precisely explains what happened in England and
the Channel Islands came within the same provisions and action
C The Silver Coins of England By Edward Hawkins FRS FAS
Published by Bernard Quaritch 15 Piccadilly London
It is natural to suppose that when the Roman power had become
established in Britain the ordinary money of that empire would form the
general circulation of this country and that British money would be for
the most part if not entirely superseded Gildas asserts that an edict
was actually issued and enforced ordaining that all money current in
this island should bear the image and superscription of the Roman
Emperor and the circumstance of Roman coins being almost daily turned
up in every part of the country amply confirms his statement It is
quite unnecessary to enter here into any description of that money as
it is perfectly well known to everyone and numerous treatises and
descriptions of it have been published in all languages
Just as stated above it would be but going over ground already
thoroughly well trodden to treat of the different Roman coins discovered
in the Channel islands They are similar to those which have come to
light on the south coast of England and in Normandy and Brittany I
will however append at length the following note from William Nicolle
Esq Jurat of Bosville Kings Cliff Jersey who has favoured me with
particulars of Roman coins found in Jersey and now in his possession
The Roman coins in my possession are 342 in number and form part of a
find which was made in February 1848 in the district of Les
Quenvais in the parish of St Brelades Jersey They were described
in a paper which was contributed to the Worcester Congress in the summer
of 1848 by the late Mr F C Lukis FSA the eminent Guernsey
archologist and which was published in the Journal of the
Archological Association Vol IV page 272
Mr Lukis saysBy a series of sections the accumulation of sand in
Les Quenvais bears marks of several inundations quite distinct in
their appearance and varying somewhat in their directions The soil and
clay beneath this sandy mass exhibit Roman vestiges of pottery and other
articles so that we cannot be far wrong in attributing the change in
this supposed fertile district to a period not far removed from the
Roman subjugation of western Europe Fragments of Roman pottery from
beneath the sandy hillocks of Les Quenvais in the possession of Col Le
Couteur of Jersey Aidedecamp to Her Majesty present indubitable
marks of the possession of this district by those conquerors And as if
a further proof were wanting in February last a jarD of coarse
earthenware which contained 400 brass coins in excellent state of
preservation was dug out from the substratum where it may have been
lodged at the time of the Roman occupation of Jersey
D This jar is in my possession
Mr Lukis then proceeds to describe at length the different varieties
of coins in this find under the respective emperors though his details
are not always correct
Of the 342 brass coins in my possession 208 are coins of Constantine
the Great or his son 86 of Licinius 16 of Maximinus 14 of Maxentius
11 of Maximianus and 7 of Constantius Chlorus
Two emperors had the common name of Maximianus The elder reigned from
286 to 310 and the younger from 305 to 311 Of the 11 coins of these
emperors there are 7 of the elder and 4 of the younger The first bear
on the obverse the legend D N Maximiano P F S Aug and the
second the words Imp C Val Maximianus P F Aug
Constantius I or Constantius Chlorus reigned one year from the
first of May 305 to July 25th 306 when he died at Eboracum now
York During the whole of this period he remained in Gaul and Britain
The 7 coins of this emperor are all of the same mintage An exact
facsimile of them is given on page 262 of Stevensons Dictionary of
Roman Coins with the slight difference that in the exergue the letters
are P L N instead of P T R
Constantine the Great reigned from 306 to 337 He was the son of
Constantius Chlorus and was with him at Eboracum at the time of his
death and there assumed the purple His son Constantius II or
Junior was named Csar by his father in 317 and died in 340 There is
no proper criterion by which to distinguish the coins of these two
emperors Of the 208 coins of Constantine in my collection there are
about 30 varieties
Maximinus II reigned from 305 to 313 Maxentius from 306 to 312 and
Licinius from 307 to 324
It is probable that all or almost all the 342 coins of this
collection were minted during the first quarter of the 4th centuryin
fact during the ten years between AD 305 and 315
ON EARLY IMPORTED COINS AND THEIR VALUES
In preceding General Observations on Coinages for the Channel Islands
I have noted that from the time of the Romans the currency continued to
be by introduced or foreign coins Naturally enough the islanders
would have only to do with coins which would be accepted by those on the
neighbouring mainland with whom they had commercial transactions There
was not sufficient interior traffic to make requisite any local coinage
of their own
It would be uninteresting and of no practical utility to treat in detail
of coins thus imported for temporary and outside as well as home
convenience and necessity but I will now give notes and extracts which
will I believe clearly indicate the nature of currency arrangements
which obtained from the days of the early kings of England
I am indebted to Le Quesnes History of JerseyE for interesting
information recorded of the coinages and currency of that island and to
the Rev G E Lee for the Guernsey records The original states
documents from which these particulars were collated are still
preserved The denominations of coins officially in use at various
periods appear thereby
E A Constitutional History of Jersey By Charles Le Quesne
Published by Longmans and Co London 1856
An order of King John dated 25th March 1208 directs the Exchequer to
reckon to the bailiffs of Southampton twenty sols which they paid for
a ship in which Stephen de Oxford sailed to Guernsey and Jersey by
order of the kingLe Quesne page 476
Orders from the English Crown in the early part of the 13th century
specified coins as follows for payment in JerseyAn order from King
John of the 11th of November 1212 directed that the Treasury should
pay to Philip dAlbigny going to the island of Jersey of which
Hasculfus de Soligny was governor 40 marks for fortifying the
islandLe Quesne page 476
In the 8th year of the reign of King Henry III 1224 there was an
order on the Treasury to deliver to the Governor of Jersey Galpidus de
Lucy 400 livres for the payment of eight knights each knight to
receive two solidos per diem for the pay of thirtyfive cavalry
soldiers each to receive twelve deniers per diem and for the pay of
sixty foot soldiers each to receive seven deniers per diemLe
Quesne page 476
There were also similar grants in the two following years
The only direct tax which the Dukes of Normandy had the right to levy
was called moneyage or fouage or hearth money From the Extent of
the Royal Revenue in Jersey prepared by Commissioners in the year 1331
this tax was also due to the Crown in Jersey It was to be levied every
three years and consisted of 12 deniers or one sol for every
hearth in the DuchyLe Quesne page 79
There is a valuable Extent of the Royal Revenues in Jersey drawn up
in the year 1331 by Robert de Norton and William de la Rue
commissioners specially appointed for the purpose In this Extent we
find that William de Barentin held the manor and fief of Rozel by
homage that this fief owed sixty sols one denier relief and that
whenever the King of England paid a visit to this island the seigneur
of this fief was bound to meet his sovereign on horseback in the sea to
the depth of the girths of the saddle and during the residence of the
king in Jersey he was to be his butler and to enjoy the known
emoluments of that office The seigneur de Rozel as also all the other
seigneurs holding in capite owed suite de cour at the chief pleas of
the Royal Court as they do still to this day For the fief de Meleches
and other fiefs held by Geffray de Carteret there was due annually by
the seigneur to the Crown the sum of forty livres one sol The fief
de Meleches reverted to the Crown as an escheat from Thomas Pinel in
the time of King John and was granted by Edward III to Renault de
Cartaret father of the then holder The fief and manor of St Ouen was
held by Renault de Carteret by homage and the relief when due was
nine livres The seigneur of this fief was bound to serve the king in
time of war at Gouray Castle at his own expense for the term of two
parts of forty days and had to provide horses and armour The wardship
of this fief and manor during the minority of the seigneur was in the
Crown The manor and fief of Saumarez was held by homage by William de
St Hillaire and owed as relief the sum of ten livres The seigneur
of the fief des Augres was in the hands of William Bras de Fer and he
had to meet the king when he arrived in Jersey on horseback to the
girths of his saddle in the sea and the fief owed as relief the sum
of seven livres Besides the services due by the fiefs de haubert we
find that a great number of persons owed stated sums annually to the
Crown for the lands held by them The names of the persons are
mentioned together with the quantity of land for which a fixed annual
sum was due For instance several persons owed for a bovata of land
the sum of eight sols annually This was the usual amount but we find
that in some cases the charge was six sols seven sols nine sols
ten sols and in a few cases as low as three sols The bovata
terr is the same as an oxgauge or an oxgate of land or as much as an
ox can till but being a compound word it may contain meadow pasture
and wood necessary for such tillage
Raulin le Francois owed for fortytwo acres of landtwelve in Trinity
parish and thirty in that of St Laurensan annual dinner to the king
at Michaelmas which was however partaken by the bailli the vicomte
and the clerk of the king This dinner could be commuted for the payment
of twelve deniers which does not raise any extravagant notions of the
style of living in those days The abbot of St Saviours however for
the priory of Bonnenuit owed to the king annually an apparently better
dinner for it was estimated at eleven sols There were also due to
the Crown as there are still to this day by various persons a
quantity of geese fowls eggs and chickens The tenants of the Crown
had various personal services to perform such as carting the wine
hay and wood belonging to the king and keeping the royal mills in
repair The right of wardship usually considered as incidental to
feudal tenures does not appear to have obtained in Jersey except in
the case of St Ouens manor The right of marriage or maritagium
which was accompanied in some cases with considerable hardships does
not appear to have prevailed or to have been exercised in this island
This claim when admitted was often the source of large fines paid by
individuals to the Crown and of much vexation and tyrannyLe
Quesne page 82
In a grant of Sir Richard Harliston dated 15th September 1479 there
is mention of both corn and money rentsthe former to the amount of 8
qrs 7 cabots 2 sexrs and the latter to 12 groats 13 sous 6
deniers The grant was for services rendered during the siege for the
recovery of Mount Orgueil CastleLe Quesne page 125
On the 26th of January 1534 the value of the current coinage was
regulated and the same thing took place about this time as regards
coins in GuernseyLe Quesne page 191
On the 20th February 1561 the price of cider in Jersey was fixed at
one Esterlin the Pot and the brewers were ordered to make beer
servoise for the use of the sick the price of which was to be fixed
by the constables and principal parishionersLe Quesne page 192
In the reign of King James I under date the 20th July 1607 a
commission was appointed under presidency of Sir Robert Gardiner
knight for the determination of differences in Jersey it also had
scope as regards Guernsey
The first article of complaint by the governor was relative to the
value of the French coins At these times there was very little if any
English coin in circulation and there was strictly speaking no fixed
standard of value in Jersey The livre tournois could scarcely be
called a standard of value and yet it was that by which the market
price of commodities was known It was the ideal currency of the island
that in which accounts were kept The actual current money was French
and any variation in its value compared to the livre tournois would
have of course to be regulated in Jersey
Any change in the value or denomination of coins is attended with
serious inconveniences and it may in some cases be highly injurious
to a large class of the community This is more likely to be the case
when the coins of two countries are adopted when two different
currencies are in circulation when any variation in the value of the
coins of one of these countries takes place and the relative value
owing to that change has to be ascertained and determined by a
legislative or administrative body Great caution is required in these
matters and at a later period the greatest discontent was caused in
Jersey and even a riot ensued from an alteration in the value of the
currency
The States of Jersey a few years before the arrival of the
commissioners perceiving that the King of France had altered and
advanced his several coins established what they considered an
equivalent value between these coins and the moneys in Jersey after the
old rates The difference was about seven per cent The French crown
was advanced to four sous more the guardesen from fifteen sous to
sixteen sous the teston from fourteen sous and a half to fifteen
sous and a half and the franc from twenty sous to twentyone sous
four deniers tournois The only money in circulation was French and
the governor claimed the payments due to the Crown in moneys at the old
rate The commissioners were of a different opinion they said that it
would be no prejudice to his Majesty or to the governor if the moneys
were received after the new advancements or alteration and besides it
would be a great contentment to the people of the island to pay the same
after the rate or value at which they had received it but as the
commissioners considered that it was a prerogative of the Crown to
diminish alter or advance any moneys current among his own subjects
they ordered that the relative value of the moneys should continue as
regulated by the States until his Majestys pleasure be known what
other course and order in times to come shall be held and kept therein
This decision of the commissioners was confirmed by the lords but it is
added in the Order that in time to come because it is a prerogative
of his Majesty and only appertaineth to royal right to diminish
alter or advance any moneys current among his subjects we require that
this be not until his Majestys express consent be thereunto first had
and obtainedLe Quesne page 225
The following two interesting extracts are from Charles the Second in
the Channel Islands by S Elliott HoskinsF
F Charles the Second in the Channel Islands by S Elliott Hoskins
MD FRS Published by Richard Bentley London
The Prince of Wales driven out of England without resources having
nevertheless at his own cost to maintain soldiers and sailors to
provide for a host of needy followers to build fortifications for his
protection and to defray the travelling expenses of the numerous
messengers going and coming from all parts was reduced to great straits
at this period Jersey could supply him but inadequately and from
France he could obtain but slender and uncertain assistance In order
therefore to improve the state of his finances and in some measure to
provide for current expenses it was resolved at the recommendation of
the council that an establishment for coining bullion should at once be
set upG A house was accordingly hired in Trinity parish Jersey from
one Michael le Guerdain which was speedily fitted up with furnaces for
fusing the precious metals and with presses and dies for striking and
stamping coin under the direction and superintendence of one Colonel
Smith who was appointed Master of the Mint
G NOTE 1In the year 1684 Charles the Second is said to have issued
tin coinage had he made it a legal tender in 1646 when it was
plentiful and precious as an article of barter the speculation might
have proved profitable
Chevalier goes on to state that the money herein coined consisted
chiefly of pieces resembling English halfcrowns which passed current
at thirty sous each The obverse of these pieces called St Georges
was stamped with an effigy of the king on horseback holding a drawn
sword in his hand and the reverse impressed with roses and harps
proper to the royal arms interlaced with fillets crosses and other
devices Some shillings were likewise coined and besides these a small
number of Jacobuses said to be worth twenty shillings apieceHoskins
Vol I page 416
Our journalist reverts to the subject of the mint set up in Jersey some
twelvemonths before which at that time promised to become a profitable
financial speculation The manager Colonel Smyth he informs us
originally a landed proprietor and a man of good family in England had
been before the troubles master of one of his Majestys provincial
mints and by virtue of his office an honorary privy councillor On the
breaking out of the civil war he commanded a regiment in the kings
service but at its termination fled with hundreds of others into
France from whence he came to Jersey with his wife and a large train
of domestics during the Prince of Waless sojourn in that island Being
desirous of exercising his former profession and moreover provided
with dies and other coining implements he succeeded in establishing a
mint under his royal highnesss sanction and the countenance of the
governor but not as we shall see under the patronage of the
chancellor of the exchequer
In a few months the concern turned out to be an utter failurepartly
owing to mismanagement partly to an alleged scarcity of bullion Smyth
a person of expensive habits who kept up an extravagant private
establishment becoming deeply involved was forced to dispose not only
of his household goods but of the greater part of his machinery
reserving merely the dies he had brought over with him Towards the end
of May he again sought refuge in France intending as he said to send
his wife into England to compound for his sequestered estates
Chevalier although he admits that Colonel Smyth etant a Jersey fit
de la monnoie de quoi je ne dis rien is a firm believer in the actual
existence of a mint from whence were issued coins of gold and silver of
legal tender Misled by his assertionson all other subjects rigidly
accuratewe confidently bestowed considerable time and industry in
seeking to obtain specimens of the St Georges jacobuses halfcrowns
and shillings so minutely described and alleged to have been struck in
Jersey The perusal however of the subjoined letter dissipated the
illusionproved that the mint was a Mississippi Scheme a South Sea
Bubble on a small scale and that the master thereof was little better
than a swindling adventurerthus accounting for the nonexistence of
the coinage in any numismatic collection
