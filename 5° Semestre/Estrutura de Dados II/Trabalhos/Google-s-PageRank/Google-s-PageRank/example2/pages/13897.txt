Ingersoll was in the other his slim whitetrousered legs jackknifed
against the darker square of the open window Near Joe his feet tucked
sociably against Joes ribs Steve Chapman the third of the trio
reclined in a Morris chair I use the word reclined advisedly for Steve
had lowered the back of the chair to its last notch and to say that he
was sitting would require a stretch of the imagination almost as long as
Steve himself Through the windows Steve could see the dark masses of
the campus elms an occasional star between the branches and by
raising his head the fraction of an inch the lights in the upper story
of Hawthorne across the yard Somewhere under the trees outside a group
of fellows were singing to the accompaniment of a wailing ukelele They
sang softly so that the words floated gently up to the open casements
just distinguishable
Years may come and years may go
Seasons ebb and seasons flow
Autumn lie neath Winters snow
Spring bring Summer verdancy
Life may line our brow with care
Time to silver turn our hair
Still to us betide whateer
Dexter well remember thee
Other memories may fade
Hopes grow dim in evnings shade
Golden friendships that we made
Aw shut up muttered Perry breaking the silence that had held them
for several minutes Joe Ingersoll laughed softly
You dont seem to like the efforts of theumsweetvoiced
choristers he said in his slow way
I dont like the sobstuff replied Perry resentfully Whats the use
of rubbing it in Why not let a fellow be cheerful after he has got
through by the skin of his teeth and kicked his books under the bed
Gosh some folks never want anyone to be happy He raised himself by
painful effort and peered out and down into the gloom Sophs Ill
bet he murmured falling back again on the cushions No one else
would sit out here on the grass and sing school songs two days before
the end I hope that idiot singing second bass will get a browntail
caterpillar down his neck
The end observed Steve Chapman You say that as if we were all going
to die the day after tomorrow Perry Cheer up Vacations coming
Vacation be blowed responded Perry Whats that amount to anyway
Nothing ever happens to me in vacation Its all well enough for you
fellows to laugh Youre going up to college together in the Fall Im
coming back to this rotten hole all alone
Not quite alone Sweet Youth corrected Joe There will be some four
hundred other fellows here
Oh well you know what I mean said Perry impatiently You and Steve
will be gone and I dont give a hang for any other chaps
He ended somewhat defiantly conscious that he had indulged in a most
unmanly display of sentiment and was glad that the darkness hid the
confusion and heightened colour that followed the confession Steve and
Joe charitably pretended not to have noticed the lamentable exhibition
of feeling and a silence followed during which the voices of the
singers once more became audible
Dexter Mother of our Youth
Dexter Guardian of the Truth
Cut it out Perry leaned over the windowsill and bawled the command
down into the darkness A defiant jeer answered him
Dont be fresh said Steve reprovingly Perry mumbled and relapsed
into silence Presently sighing as he changed his position Joe said
I believe Perrys right about vacation Steve Nothing much ever does
happen to a fellow in Summer I believe Ive had more fun in school than
at home the last six years
The others considered the statement a minute Then Correct said
Steve Its so I guess Were always crazy to get home in June and
just as crazy to get back to school again in September and I believe we
all have more good times here than at home
Of course we do agreed Perry animatedly Anyway I do Summers are
all just the same My folks lug me off to the Water Gap and we stay
there until its time to come back here I play tennis and go motoring
and sit around on the porch andandbathe
Lets hope so interpolated Joe gravely
And nothing really interesting ever happens ended Perry despairingly
Gee Id like to be a pirate oror something
Summers are rather deadly assented Steve We go to the seashore
but the place is filled with swells and about all they do is change
their clothes eat and sleep When you get ready for piracy Perry let
me know will you Id like to signon
Put me down too said Joe Ive always had aumsneaking idea that
Id make a bully pirate Im naturally bloodthirsty and cruel And Ive
got a mental list of folks whoumId like to watch walk the plank
Fellows of our ages have a rotten time of it anyway Perry grumbled
Were too old to play kids games and too young to do anything worth
while What Id like to do
Proceed Sweet Youth Joe prompted after a moment
Well Id like toto start something Id like to get away somewhere
and do things Im tired of loafing around in white flannels all day
and keeping my hands clean And Im tired of dabbing whitewash on my
shoes Didnt you fellows ever think that youd like to get good and
dirty and not have to care Wouldnt you like to put on an old flannel
shirt and a pair of khaki trousers and some sneakers andand roll in
the mud
Elemental stuff murmured Joe Hes been reading Jack London
Well thats the way I feel lots of times said Perry defiantly Im
tired of being clean and white and Im tired of dinner jackets and Im
sick to death of hotel porches Gee a healthy chap never was intended
to lead the life of a white poodle with a pink ribbon around his neck
Me for some roughstuff
Youre dead right too agreed Steve That kind of thing is all right
for Joe of course Joes a naturalborn fusser Hes never happier
than when hes dolled up in a sportshirt and a lavender scarf and
toasting marshmallows But
Is that so inquired Joe with deep sarcasm If I was half the
fusser you are
What I want interrupted Perry warming to his theme is adventure
Id like to hunt big game or discover the North Pole
Youre a year or two late murmured Joe
or dig for hidden treasure
You shouldumchange your course of reading advised Joe Too much
Roosevelt and Peary and Stevenson is your trouble Read the classics for
awhileor the Patty Books
Thats all right but you chaps are just the same only you wont own
up to it
One of us will said Steve and does
Make it two yawned Joe Beneath thisumthis polished exterior
there beats a heartI mean there flows the red blood of
Look here fellows why not asked Steve
Why not what asked Perry
Why not have adventures They say that all you have to do is look for
them
Dont you believe it Ive looked for them for years and Ive never
seen one yet Perry swung his feet to the floor and sat up
Well not at Delaware Water Gap naturally Youve got to move around
son You dont find them by sitting all day with your feet on the rail
of a hotel piazza
Where do you find them then Perry demanded
Steve waved a hand vaguely aloft into the greenish radiance of the lamp
All round North east south and west Land or sea Adventures
Perry are for the adventurous Now here we are three ablebodied
fellows fairly capable of looking after ourselves in most situations
tired of the humdrum life of Summer resorts Whats to prevent our
spending a couple of months together and finding some adventures Of
course we cant go to Africa and shoot lions and warthogswhatever
they may beand we cant fit out an Arctic exploration party and
discover Ingersoll Land or Bush Inlet or Chapmans Passage but we could
have a mighty good time Id say and even if we didnt have many
hairbreadth escapes Ill bet it would beat chasing tennis balls and
doing the Australian crawl and keeping our white shoes and trousers
clean
We could be as dirty as we liked sighed Perry ecstatically Lead me
to it
It sounds positively fascinating drawled Joe but just how would we
go about it My folks for some unfathomable reason think quite a lot
of me and I dont just see them letting me amble off like that
especially inumsuch disreputable company
I should think theyd be glad to be rid of you for a Summer said
Perry Anyhow lets make believe its possible fellows and talk
about it
Why isnt it possible asked Steve My folks would raise objections
as well as yours Joe but I guess I could fetch them around After all
theres no more danger than in staying at home and trying to break your
neck driving an automobile sixty miles an hour Lets really consider
the scheme fellows Im in earnest I want to do it What Perry said is
just what Ive been thinking without saying Why hang it a fellow
needs something of the sort to teach him sense and give him experience
This thing of hanging around a hotel porch all Summer makes a regular
mollycoddle of a fellow Im for revolt
Hear Hear cried Perry enthusiastically Revolution A bas la
Summer Resort Viva Adventure
Shut up idiot Do you really mean it Steve or are you just talking
If you mean it Im with you to the lastumdrop of blood old chap
Ive always wanted to revolt about something anyway One of my
ancestors helped throw the English breakfast tea into Boston Harbour
But I dont want to get all het up about this unless theres really
something in it besides jabber
We start the first day of July replied Steve decisively
Where for
That is the question friends Shall it be by land or sea
Land said Joe
Sea said Perry
The majority rules and I cast my vote with Perry Adventures are more
likely to be found on the water I think and its adventures we are
looking for
But I always get seasick objected Joe And when Im seasick you
couldnt tempt me with any number of adventures I simplyumdont
seem to enthuse much at such times
You can take a lemon with you suggested Perry cheerfully My
grandmother
Joe shook his head They dont do you any good he said sadly
Dont they My grandmother
Bother your grandmother How do we go to sea Steve Swim oror how
We get my fathers cruiser replied Steve simply Shes a
fortyfooter and togged out like an oceanliner Has everything but a
swimmingpool She
Nix on the luxuries interrupted Perry The simple life for me
Lets hire an old motheaten sailboat
Nothing doing Sweet Youth If Im to risk my life on the heaving ocean
I want something under me Besides being seasick is rotten enough
anyhow without having to roll around in the cockpit of a twobytwice
sailboat That cruiser listens well Steve butumwill papa fall for
it If it was my father
I think he will answered Steve seriously Dad doesnt have much
chance to use the boat himself and this Summer hes likely to be in the
city more than ever The trouble is that the Cockatoo is almost too
big for three of us to handle
Oh piffle
Its so though I know the boat Perry Shes pretty big when it comes
to making a landing or picking up a mooring If we were all fairly good
seamen it might be all right but I wouldnt want to try to handle the
Cockatoo without a couple of sailors aboard
I once sailed a knockabout said Perry
And I had a greatgrandfather who was a sea captain offered Joe
encouragingly What price greatgrandfather
Dont see where your grandfather and Perrys grandmother come into
this replied Steve How would it do if we gathered up two or three
other fellows The Cockatoo will accommodate six
Who could we get asked Joe dubiously
Neil Fairleigh for one
How about Han offered Joe
Hanford always wants to boss everything objected Perry
He knows boats though and so does Neil said Steve And theyre
both good fellows That would make five of us and five isnt too many
We cant afford to hire a cook you know at least I cant and someone
will have to look after that end of it Who can cook
I cant Perry made the disclaimer with great satisfaction
No more can I said Joe cheerfully Let Neil be cook
I guess well all have to take a try at it I dare say any of us can
fry an egg and make coffee and you can buy almost everything ready to
eat nowadays
Tell you whos a whale of a cook said Perry eagerly Thats Ossie
Brazier Remember the time we camped at Mirror Lake last Spring
Remember the flapjacks he made Mmm
I didnt go said Steve What sort of a chap is Brazier I dont know
him very well
Well Oscars one of the sort who will do anything just as long as he
thinks he doesnt have to replied Joe If we could get him to come
along and tell him that heumsimply must not ask to do the cooking
whythere you are
Merely a matter of diplomacy laughed Steve Well we might have
Brazier instead of Hanfordor Neil
Why not have them all if the boat will hold six asked Joe Seems to
me the more we have the less each of us will have to do I mean he
continued above the laughter thatuma division of labour
We get you said Perry But say I wish youd stop talking about it
fellows Im going to be disappointed when I wake up and find its only
a bright and gaudy dream
It isnt a dream answered Steve unless you say so Ill go and
Ill guarantee to get the Cockatoo without expense other than the cost
of running her If you and Joe can get your folks to let you come and
we can get hold of say two other decent chaps to fill the crew why
well do it
Do you honestly mean it demanded Perry incredulously Gee Ill get
permission if I have toto go without it
How about you Joe
UmI guess I could manage it How long would we be gone
A month Two if you like Start the first of July or as soon after as
possible and get back in August
How much would it cost us inquired Perry Im not a millionaire like
you chaps
Wouldnt want to say offhand Wed have to figure that Thats another
reason for filling the boat up though The more we have the less
everyones share of the expense will be
Lets have the whole six then for moneys scarce in my family these
days Lets make it a club fellows The Club of Six or something of
that sort It sounds fine
Take in another fellow and call it The Lucky Seven suggested Joe
We might not be lucky though laughed Steve Ill tell you a better
name
Shoot
The Adventure Club
CHAPTER II
THE CLUB GROWS
And that is the way in which it happened It began in fun and ended
quite seriously They sat up in Number 17 Sumner until long after
bedtime that night figuring the cost of the expedition planning the
cruise even listing supplies The more they talked about it the more
their enthusiasm grew Perry was for having Steve send a night message
then and there to his father asking for the boat but Steve preferred to
wait until he reached home and make the request by word of mouth
He would just think I was fooling or crazy if I telegraphed he
explained Tomorrow well try to dig up three other fellows to go
along and then as soon as we all get home well find out whether our
folks will stand for it You must all telegraph me the first thing
Dont wait to write because I must know as soon as possible I dare say
theres work to be done on the Cockatoo before shes ready for the
water and we dont want to have to wait around until the end of July
The fun of doing anything is to do it right off If you wait you lose
half the pleasure Now youd better beat it Perry Its after ten If
you meet a proctor close your eyes and make believe youre walking in
your sleep
Perry reached his own room on the floor above without being sighted
however and subsequently spent a sleepless hour in joyous anticipation
of at last finding some of those adventures that all his life he had
longed for And when he did at length fall asleep it was to have the
most outlandish dreams visions in which he endured shipwreck fought
pirates and was all but eaten by cannibals The most incongruous phase
of the dream as recollected on waking was that the Cockatoo had
been not a motorboat at all but a trolleycar He distinctly
remembered that the pirates on boarding it had each dropped a nickel
in the box
Fortunately for the success of the Adventure Club the next morning held
no duties In the afternoon the deciding baseball game was to be played
but except for gathering belongings together preliminary to packing
nothing else intervened between now and the graduation programme of the
morrow Hence it was an easy matter to hold what might be termed the
first meeting of the club Besides the originators there were present
Messrs Fairleigh Hanford and Brazier After Steve had locked the door
to prevent interruption he presented to the newcomers a summary of the
scheme It was received with enthusiasm and unanimous approval but Neil
Fairleigh and Oscar Brazier sadly admitted that in their cases parental
permission was extremely doubtful George Hanford whose parents were
dead and who was under the care of a guardian thought that in his case
there would be no great difficulty The other two viewed him a trifle
enviously Then because one may always hope they had to hear the
particulars and each secretly began to fashion arguments to overcome the
objections at home Finally Oscar Brazier inquired interestedly
Who is going to cook for you
Oh well take turns maybe answered Joe Or we might hire a cook
Joe stole a look at Steve Oscar only shuffled his feet
I say hire remarked Perry Any of us could do it after a fashion I
dare say but you get frightfully hungry on the water and need good
stuff well cooked and lots of it
Yes agreed Steve any of us would make an awful mess of it
Cookings an art
Oscar cleared his throat and frowned Youd have to pay a lot for a
cook he said It isnt hard really I could do itif I were going
along
Thats so George Hanford confirmed But the rest seemed
unflatteringly doubtful The silence was almost embarrassing At last
Joe said hurriedly
Well we dont have to decide that now Besides if you cant come with
usum His voice trailed off into a relieved silence Oscar smiled
haughtily
Thats all right he said If you prefer a cook say so Only if I
did go Id be willing to do the cooking and Ill bet I could do it as
well as any cook you could hire Isnt it so Han
Yes I call you a mighty nifty cook Ossie Ive eaten your biscuits
more than once Flapjacks too
Well said Joe politely camp cooking is umdifferent I guess from
regular cooking Of course I dont say Ossie couldnt do it mind you
butwe wouldnt want to take chances On the whole I think it would be
best to have a regular cook
We might let Ossie try it suggested Perry judicially
Oh Im not crazy about it disclaimed Oscar piqued If you prefer
to pay out good money for a cook
Not at all interrupted Steve soothingly We want to do the whole
thing as cheaply as we can I see no harm in leaving the cooking end of
it to you Brazier that is if you can go
Im going to make a big try for it declared Oscar resolutely If my
folks wont let me theytheyll wish they had
Whereupon emboldened by Oscars stand Neil Fairleigh expressed the
conviction that he too could manage it some way I dare say that if I
tell my dad that all you chaps are going he will think its all right
It wouldnt be for all Summer anyway would it
The idea now responded Steve is to start out for a months cruise
and extend it if we cared to I suppose any of us that got tired could
quit after the month was up He smiled Wed all have to signon for a
month though
Righto agreed Hanford What about electing officers Oughtnt we to
do that Someone ought to be in charge I should think
Sure exclaimed Joe Well ballot Throw that pad over here Ossie
Wait a minute said Steve Ive been thinking fellows The
Cockatoo will hold six comfortably The main cabin has berths for four
and the owners cabin for two but if Im not mistaken the berths in the
owners cabin are extension and if they are we could bunk three fellows
in there or even four at a pinch That would give us room for seven or
eight in all Eight might make it a bit crowded but shes a big roomy
boat and I think we could do with seven fellows all right And sevens a
lucky number too So suppose we take in one more while were at it
The more the merrier agreed Joe Who have you got in mind
Steve shook his head No one but I guess we can think of a fellow
Theres
Steve was interrupted by a knock on the door and when Hanford who was
nearest had at a nod from Steve unlocked the portal a tall rather
seriousfaced youth of seventeen entered
Oh am I buttingin he asked I didnt know Ill come back later
Joe Philip Street smiled apologetically and started a retreat but
Steve called him back
Hold on Phil he cried Come in here Youre the very fellow we
want Close the door and find a seat will you
By Jove thats so exclaimed Joe and the others heartily endorsed
him Oddly enough not one would have thought of Phil Street in all
probability but each recognised the fact that he was the ideal fellow
to complete the membership Steve Joe aiding and the others attempting
to outlined the plan If they had expected signs of enthusiasm from
Phil they were doomed to disappointment for that youth listened
silently and attentively until they had ended and then asked simply
When are you planning to get away
As near the first of the month as we can replied Steve
Im afraid I couldnt go then said Phil Im a delegate to the CB
Convention you see and that doesnt end until the sixth
Id forgotten that said Joe disappointedly
Whats CB stand for inquired Hanford
Christian Brotherhood supplied Steve Look here Phil could you go
after the sixth
Yes Id love to thanks
All right then youre signedon If we get away before that well pick
you up somewhere If we dont you can start with us How is that
Quite satisfactory answered Phil
But are you sure your folks will let you asked Perry
Oh yes I spend my Summers about as I like
Think of that sighed Perry Gee I wish my folks were like that
I guess said Steve that Phils folks know he wont get into
trouble Perry while yours are pretty certain that you will It makes a
difference Now we can go ahead with that election cant we How about
nominations
No need of them declared Joe What officers do we want
Well this is a clubthe Adventure Club Phil is the name weve
chosenand so I suppose we ought to have a president and a
vicepresident and
Rot said Perry Too highsounding Lets elect a captain and a
treasurer and let it go at that
I never heard of a club having a captain Oscar Brazier objected
Nor anyone else agreed Joe Lets follow the Nihilist scheme and
elect a Number One a Number Two and a Number Three Number One can be
the boss a sort of president you know Number Two can correspond to a
vicepresident and Number Three can be secretary and treasurer Hows
that
Suits me said Steve Tear up some pieces of paper Perry Well each
vote for the three officers writing the names in order then the fellow
getting the most votes
I dont know as I ought to vote said Neil Fairleigh because Im not
sure I can go Maybe Id better not eh
Oh shucks never mind that replied Perry You can join the club
anyway and be a sort of nonresident member Here you are fellows
Whos got a pen or something
During the ensuing two or three minutes there was comparative silence in
Number 17 and while the seven occupants of the room busy themselves
with pens or pencils let us look them over since we are likely to spend
some time in their company from now on
First of all there is Steve Chapman seventeen years of age a tall
wellbuilt and nicely proportioned youth with black hair and eyes a
quick determined manner and an incisive speech Steve was Football
Captain last Fall Next him sits George Hanford Han as the boys call
him is eighteen also a senior and also a football player He is big
and rangey goodnatured and popular and is president of the senior
class
Joe Ingersolls age is seventeen He is Steves junior by two months He
is of medium height rather thin light complexioned and has peculiarly
pale eyes behind the round spectacles he wears Joe is first baseman on
the Nine and a remarkably competent one He is slow of speech and
possesses a dry humour that on occasion can be uncomfortably ironical
Beside him Perry Bush is a complete contrast for Perry is
largelimbed rather heavy of build frecklefaced redhaired and
jolly He has very dark blue eyes and in spite of a moonshaped
countenance is distinctly pleasing to look at he is sixteen
Neil Fairleigh and Phil Street are of an age seventeen but in other
regards are quite unalike Neil is of medium height with his full
allowance of flesh and has hair the hue of new rope and greyblue eyes
He is eventempered easygoing and if truth must be told somewhat
lazy Phil Street is quite tall rather thin and dark complexioned a
nicelooking somewhat serious youth whose infrequent smile is worth
waiting for He is an Honor Man a distinction attained by no other
member of our party save Steve The last of the seven is Oscar Brazier
and Ossie as the boys call him is sixteen years old short and
square stronglymade and conspicuous for neither beauty nor scholarly
attainments Ossie has a snub nose a lot of rebellious brown hair red
cheeks and a wide mouth that is usually smiling Renowned for his
goodnature he is nevertheless a hard worker at whatever he undertakes
and if he sometimes shows a suspicious disposition it is only because
his goodnature has been frequently imposed on
When the last pencil had stopped scratching Joe gathered the slips
together and after a moments figuring announced that Steve had been
elected Number One without a dissenting vote that he himself had been
made Number Two and that Phil was Number Three If Perry felt
disappointment he hid it and when Phil declared that in his opinion
Perry should have been elected instead of him since Perry was so to
say a charter member Perry promptly disclaimed any desire of the sort
No thanks he said If I was secretary Id have to keep the accounts
and all that sort of thing and Im no good at it Youre the very
fellow for the job Phil
The assemblage broke up shortly after to meet again that evening at
eight Steve undertaking to have a map on hand then so that they might
plan their cruise As none of the seven was bound to secrecy what
happened is only what might have been expected By the time the ball
game was half over Steve and Joe had received enough applications for
membership in the Adventure Club to have in Joes words filled an
ocean liner It is probable that a large proportion of the applicants
could not have obtained permission to join the expedition but they were
each and all terribly enthusiastic and eager to join and it required
all of Steves and Joes diplomacy to turn them away without hurting
their feelings Wink Wheelerhis real name was Warren but no one ever
called him thatrefused politely but firmly to take no for an answer
Wink said he didnt care where he bunked and that he never ate anything
on a boat anyway because he was always too seasick to bother about
meals
One more wont matter Steve Wink pleaded Be a good chap and let me
in wont you My folks are going out to California this Summer and I
dont want to go and theyll let me do anything I like Tell you what
Steve If youll take me Ill buy something for the boat Ill make the
club a present ofof a tender or an anchor or whatever you say
Steve found it especially hard to turn Wink down because he liked the
fellow just as everyone else did Wink was eighteen and had been five
years getting through school but he was a big goodhearted jovial
boy and as Steve reflected one who would be a desirable companion on
such an adventure as had been planned Steve at last told Wink that he
would speak to the others about him that evening but that Wink was not
to get his hopes up and Wink took himself off whistling cheerfully and
quite satisfied But when Steve tentatively broached the matter of
including one more member in the person of Wink Wheeler Joe staggered
him by announcing that he had promised Harry Corwin to intercede for the
latter
He pestered the life out of me explained Joe ruefully and I finally
told him Id ask you fellows But I suppose we cant take two more Nine
wouldumbe rather overdoing it eh
Everyone agreed that it would Han suggested that Wink Wheeler and Harry
Corwin might toss up for the privilege of joining the club After all
he added we arent all of us certain that we can go If one or two of
us drop out therell be room for Wink and Harry too
Seems to me said Phil Street it might be a good plan to enlarge
the membership to say twelve and let the new members find a boat of
