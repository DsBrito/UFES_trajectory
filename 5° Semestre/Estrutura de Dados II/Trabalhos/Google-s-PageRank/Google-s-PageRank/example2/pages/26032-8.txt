Discover it for yourself
To read about the virtues of Morton Salt isnt half so pleasant as
finding them out for yourself
It certainly gives you a sense of security and content to find that
Mortons wont stick or cake in the package when you want it that it

Youll like its distinct bracing flavor too Better keep a couple of
packages always handy

Windows and Their Fitments
By Mary Ann Wheelwright
Through the glamour of the Colonial we are forced to acknowledge the
classic charm shown in late seventeenth and early eighteenth century
window designs Developed as they were by American carpenters who were
stimulated by remembrance of their early impressions of English
architecture received in the mother land there is no precise or
spiritless copy of English details rather there is expressed a vitality
that has been brought out by earnest effort to reproduce the spirit
desired Undoubtedly the lasting success of early American craftsmanship
has been due to the perfect treatment of proportions as related one to
the other That these are not imitations is proved by an occasional
clumsiness which would be impossible if they were exact copies of their
more highly refined English prototypes
The grasp of the builders mind is vividly revealed in the construction
of these windows for while blunders are often made yet successes are
much more frequent They are evolved from remembered motives that have
been unified and balanced that they might accord with the exterior and
be knitted successfully into the interior trim Some of these windows
still grace seventeenth century houses and are found not only on old
southern plantations but all through New England more especially along
the sea coast True products are they of Colonial craftsmanship brought
into existence by skilled artisans who have performed their work so
perfectly that today they are found unimpaired striking a dominant note
in accord with the architectural feeling of the period
There is no question but that windows such as these lend character to
any house provided of course that they coincide with the period
Doubtless the designing of modified Colonial houses is responsible in
part for the presentday revival of interest not solely in windows of
the Colonial period but also in that which immediately preceded and
followed it
Illustration GROUP WINDOWS ON STAIRWAY
The first ornamental windows were of the casement type copied from
English cottage homes Like those they opened outward and were
designed with small panes either diamond or square shaped As they were
in use long before glass was manufactured in this country the Colonists
were forced to import them direct from England Many were sent ready to
be inserted with panes already leaded in place Proof of this is
afforded by examples still in existence These often show strange
patches or cutting The arrangement of casements varies from single
windows to groups of two or three and they were occasionally
supplemented by fixed transoms Surely no phase of window architecture
stands out more conspicuously in the evolution of our early designs than
the casement with its tiny panes ornamented with handwrought iron
straphinges which either flared into arrow heads rounded into knobs
or lengthened into points That they were very popular is shown from the
fact that they withstood the changes of fashion for over a century not
being abolished until about the year 1700
Little drapery is needed in casement windows where they are divided by
mullions The English draw curtain is admirable for this purpose It can
be made of casement cloth with narrow side curtains and valance of
bright material A charming combination was worked out in a summer
cottage The glass curtains were of black and white voile with tiny
figures introduced This was trimmed with a narrow black and white
fringe while the overdrapery had a black background patterned with old
rose
Illustration GROUPED WINDOWS WITH SQUARE PANES LACE GLASS CURTAINS
AND CRETONNE OVER CURTAINS
In the field of architectural progress more especially during the last
few years there have arisen vast possibilities for the development of
odd windows These if properly placed showing correct grouping are
artistic not only from the outside but from the inside as well The
artistic woman realizing the value of color will fill a bright china
bowl with glowing blossoms and place it in the center of a wide window
sill where the sun playing across them will carry their cheerful
color throughout the room She also trains vines to meander over the
window pane working out a delicate tracery that is most effective
suspending baskets of ferns from the upper casement that she may break
the length of her Colonial window Thus through many artifices she
causes her simple room to bloom and blossom like a rose

The progress made in window architecture is more apparent as we study
the early types Then small attention was paid to details the windows
placed with little thought of artistic grouping Their only object to
light the room often they stood like soldiers on parade in a straight
row lining the front of the house
Out of the past has come a vast array of period windows each one of
which is of interest They display an unmistakable relationship to one
another for while we acknowledge that they differ in detail and
ornamentation yet do they invariably show in their conception some
underlying unity There is no more fascinating study than to take each
one separately and carefully analyze its every detail for thus only can
we recognize and appreciate the links which connect them with the early
American types
We happen upon them not only in the modified Colonial structures but in
houses in every period of architecture It may be only a fragment
possibly a choice bit of carving or it may be a window composed in the
oldfashioned manner of from nine to thirty panes introduced in
Colonial days for the sake of avoiding the glass tax levied upon them if
over a certain size A charming example of a reproduction of one of
these thirtypaned windows may be seen in a rough plaster house built in
Salem after the great fire The suggestion was taken from an old
historic house in a fine state of preservation in Boxford Mass
The first American homes derived their plans and their finish from
medieval English tradition They were forced to utilize such materials
as they were able to obtain and step by step they bettered the
construction and ornamentation of their homes As increasing means and
added material allowed they planned and executed more elaborately not
only in size and finish but in the adding of window casings caps and
shutters
The acme of Colonial architecture was reached with the development of
the large square houses with exquisitely designed entrances and
porticos These often showed recessed and arched windows also those of
the Palladian type At the Lindens Danvers Mass a memoryhaunted
mansion may be seen one of the finest examples of these recessed
windows This famous dwelling the work of an English architect who
built it in about 1770 is linked with American history through its use
by General Gage as his headquarters during the Revolution
The recessed windows that are found here reveal delicate mouldings in
the classic bead and filet design and are surmounted by an elaborate
moulded cornice which lends great dignity to the room This is
supported by delicate pilasters and balanced by the swelling base shown
below the window seats Such a window as this is no mere incident or
cut in the wall on the contrary it is structural treatment of
woodwork Another feature of pronounced interest may be noted on the
stair landing where a charming Palladian window overlooks the
oldfashioned boxbordered garden that has been laid out at the rear
