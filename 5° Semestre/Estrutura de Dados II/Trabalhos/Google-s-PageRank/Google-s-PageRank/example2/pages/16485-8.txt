though your partiality to me might induce you to overlook it the public
did not I mean that of writing when my temper was disturbed either by
cross incidents I met with upon the road or disagreeable news which
often followed me from my own country into this I need not tell a man
of your discernment in what a different light all objects whether
animate or inanimate appear to those whose temper is disturbed
either by ill health ill treatment or what is perhaps more prevalent
than either the chagrin he may feel at not being rated in the
estimation of others according to that value he puts upon himself
Could Dr Smollett rise from the dead and sit down in perfect health
and good temper and read his travels through France and Italy he
would probably find most of his anger turned upon himself But poor
man he was ill and meeting with what every stranger must expect to
meet at most French inns want of cleanliness imposition and
incivility he was so much disturbed by those incidents that to say no
more of the writings of an ingenious and deceased author his travels
into France and Italy are the least entertaining in my humble
opinion of all his works Indeed I have observed that most travellers
fall into one extreme or the other and either are all panegyric or all
censure in which case all they say cannot be just for as all nations
are governed by men and the bulk of men of all nations live by artifice
of one kind or other the few men who pass among them without any
sinister views cannot avoid feeling and but few from complaining of
the ill treatment they meet with not considering one of Swifts shrewd
remarks I never said he knew a man who could not bear the
misfortunes of another perfectly like a Christian
Remember therefore when I tell you how ill I have been treated either
by Lords or Aubergists or how dirtily served by either it is to
prepare myself and you too to be content with neighbours fare
When a man writes remarks upon the manners and customs of other nations
he should endeavour to wean himself from all partiality for his own and
I need not tell you that I am in full possession of that single
qualification which I hope will make you some amends for my defects in
all the others for it is certainly unjust uncandid and illiberal to
pronounce a custom or fashion absurd because it does not coincide with
our ideas of propriety A Turk who travelled into England would upon
his return to Constantinople tell his countrymen that at Canterbury
bring out of opium his host did not know even what he demanded
and that it was with some difficulty he found out that there were shops
in the town where opium was sold and even then it was with greater
he could prevail upon the vender of it to let him have above half an
ounce if he were questioned why all these precautions he would tell
them laughingly that Englishmen believe opium to be a deadly poison
and those people suspected that he either meant to kill himself or to
poison another man with it
A French gentleman who travelled some years since into Spain had
letters of recommendation to a Spanish Bishop who received him with
every mark of politeness and treated him with much hospitality soon
after he retired to his bedchamber a priest entered itA holding a
vessel in his hand which was covered with a clean napkin he said
something but the Frenchman understanding but little Spanish
intimated by signs his thanks and desired him to put it down
believing that his friend the Bishop had sent him a plate of
sweetmeats fruit iced cream or some kind of refreshment to eat before
he went to bed or to refresh his exhausted spirits in the night but
his astonishment was great indeed when he found the priest put the
present under the side of the bed and more so when he perceived that
it was only a pot de chambrefor says the Frenchman in Spain
they do not use the chaise percee The Frenchman is surprized at the
Spaniard for not using so convenient a vehicle the Englishman is
equally surprized that the Frenchman doesthe Frenchman is always
attentive to his own person and scarce ever appears but clean and well
dressed while his house and private apartments are perhaps covered with
litter and dirt and in the utmost confusionthe Englishman on the
other hand often neglects his external dress but his house is always
exquisitely clean and every thing in it kept in the nicest order and
who shall say which of the two judge the best for their own ease and
happiness I am sure the Frenchman will not give up his powdered hair
and laced coat for a clean house nor do I believe those fineries would
sit quietly upon the back of an Englishman in a dirty one In short my
dear sir we must take the world and the things in it as they are it
is a dirty world but like France has a vast number of good things in
it and such as I meet with in this my third tour which shall be a
long one if I am not stopped by the way you shall have such an
account of as I am able to convey to you I will not attempt to top the
traveller upon you nor raise monuments of wonder where none are to be
seen there is real matter enough to be found upon this great continent
to amuse a man who travels slowly over it to see what is to be seen
and who wishes not to be seen himself My style of travelling is such
that I can never be disturbed in mind for want of respect but rather be
surprised when I meet with even common civility And after all what
does it signify whether Monsieur ou Tel travels in a laced coat et
tres bien mis attended by half a dozen servants or as Pope says
will run
The Lord knows whither in a chaise and one
I am yours c

LETTER II
June 25th 1766
Before I leave Calais let me remind you that an English guinea is
worth more than a Louis dor and observe that the first question my
friend Mons Dessein at the Hotel DAngleterre will put to you
after he has made his bow and given you a side look as a cock does at
a barleycorn is whether you have any guineas to change because he
gets by each guinea full weight ten Sols By this hint you will
conclude he will not upon your return ask you for your French Gold
but in this too you will be mistaken for he finds an advantage in that
also he will not indeed give you guineas but in lieu thereof he has
always a large quantity of Birmingham Shillings to truck with you for
your Louis dors I am afraid when Lord North took into
consideration the state of the gold coin he did not know that the
better state it is put into in England is the surest means of
transporting it into France and other countries and that scarce a
single guinea which travellers carry with them to France and many
hundred go every week ever returns to England Beside this the
quantity of gold carried over to the ports of Dunkirk Boulogne and
Calais by the Smugglers who always pay ready money is incredible
but as money and matters of that kind are what I have but little
concern in I will not enlarge upon a subject no way interesting to me
and shall only observe that my landlord Mons Dessein who was
behindhand with the world ten years ago is now become one of the
richest men in Calais has built a little Theatre in his garden and
has united the profitable business of a Banker to that of a Publican
and by studying the Gout of the English nation and changing their
gold into French currency has made they say a Demi Plumb
Notwithstanding the contiguity of Calais to England and the great
quantity of poultry vegetables game c which are bought up every
marketday and conveyed to your coast I am inclined to believe there
are not many parts of France where a man who has but little money can
make it go further than in this town nor is there any town in England
where the fishery is conducted with so much industry
Yesterday I visited my unfortunate daughter at the convent at
Ardresbut why do I say unfortunate She is unfortunate only in the
eyes of the world not in her own nor indeed in mine because she
assured me she is happy I left her here you know ten years ago by
way of education and learning the language but the smallpox which
seized her soon after made such havock on a face rather favoured by
nature that she desired to hide it from the world and spend her life
in that retirement which I had chosen only to qualify her for the
world I left her a child I found her a sensible woman full of
affection and duty and her mangled and seamed face so softened by an
easy mind and a good conscience that she appeared in my partial eyes
rather an agreeable than a plain woman but she did not omit to signify
to me that what others considered her misfortune she considered as it
was not her fault a happy circumstance if my face is plain said she
my heart is light and I am sure it will make as good a figure in the
earth as the fairest and most beautiful My only concern is that I
find the Prieure of this convent either for want of more knowledge
or more money or both had received as parlour boarders some English
ladies of very suspicious characters As the conversation of such women
might interrupt and disturb that peace and tranquillity of mind in
which I found my daughter I told the Prieure my sentiments on that
subject not only with freedom but with some degree of severity and
endeavoured to convince her how very unwarrantably if not
irreligiously she acted An abandoned or vicious woman may paint the
pleasures of this world in such gaudy colours to a poor innocent Nun
so as to induce her to forget or become less attentive to the
professions she has made to the next
It was near this town you know that the famous interview passed
between Henry the Eighth and Francis the First in the year 1520 and
though it lasted twentyeight days and was an event which produced at
that time so many amusements to all present and so much conversation
throughout Europe the inhabitants of this town or Calais seem to
know little of it but that one of the bastions at Ardres is called
the Bastion of the Two KingsThere still remains however in the
front of one of the houses in Calais upon an ornamented stone cut in
old letter
God Save the King
And I suppose that stone was put where it now remains by some loyal
subject before the King arrived as it is in a street which leads from
the gate now stopped up which Henry passed through
LETTER III
In a very few days I shall leave this town and having procured letters
of recommendation from some men of fashion now in England to their
friends in Spain I am determined to traverse this and make a little
tour into that kingdom so you may expect something more from me than
merely such remarks as may be useful to you on any future tour you make
in France I mean to conduct you at least over the Pyrenean hills to
Barcelona for though I have been two or three times before in Spain
it was early in life and when my mind was more employed in observing
the customs and manors of the birds and beasts of the field than
of their lords and masters and made too on the other side of that
kingdom Having seen as much of Paris as I desired some years ago I
intend to pass through the provinces of Artois Champaigne
Bourgogne and so on to Lyons by which route you will perceive I
shall leave the capital of this kingdom many leagues on my right hand
and see some considerable towns and taste now and then of the most
delicious wines on the spots which produce them beside this I have a
great desire to see the remains of a Roman subterranean town lately
discovered in Champaigne which perhaps may gratify my curiosity in
some degree and thereby lessen that desire I have long had of visiting
Herculaneum an underground town you know I always said I would
visit if a certain person happened to be put underground before me
but the CAUSE and the event in all human affairs are not to be
fathomed by men for though the event happened the cause frustrated
my design and I must cross the Pyranean not the Alpian hills But
lest I forget it let me tell you that as my travelling must be upon
the frugal plan I have sold my fourwheel postchaise to Mons
Dessein for twentytwo guineas and bought a French cabriolet for
ten and likewise a very handsome English coachhorse a little touched
in the wind indeed for seven This equipage I have fitted up with every
convenience I can contrive to carry me my wife two daughters and all
my other baggage you will conclude therefore light as the latter
may be we are bien charge but as we move slowly not above seven
leagues a day I shall have the more leisure to look about me and to
consider what sort of remarks may prove most worthy of communicating
from time to time to you I shall be glad to leave this town though it
is in one respect something like yoursB everyday producing many
strange faces and some very agreeable acquaintance The arrival of
the packetboats from Dover constitutes the principal amusement of this
town
B BATH
The greater part of the English transports who come over do not
proceed much further than to see the tobacco plantations near St
Omers nor is their return home less entertaining than their arrival
as many of them are people of such quick parts that they acquire in
a weeks tour to Dunkirk Bologne and St Omers the language
dress and manners of the country You must not however expect to hear
again from me till I am further afield But lest I forget to mention
it in a future letter let me refresh your memory as to your conduct at
Dover at Sea and at Calais In the first of these three disagreeable
places and the first is the worst you will soon be applied to by one
of the Captains of the packets or byeboats and if you hire the boat
to yourself he will demand five guineas if you treat with another it
is all one because they are all except one partners and equally
interested and therefore will abate nothing Captain Watson is the
only one who swims upon his own bottom and as he is a good seaman
and has a clean convenient nay an elegant vessel I would rather turn
the scale in his favour because I am as you will be an enemy to all
associations which have a tendency to imposition upon the public and
oppression to such who will not join in the general confederacy yet I
must in justice to the Captains of the confederate party acknowledge
that their vessels are all good well found and that they are civil
decentbehaved men As it is natural for them to endeavour to make the
most of each trip they will if they can foist a few passengers upon
you even after you have taken the vessel to your own use only If you
are alone this intrusion is not agreeable but if you have ladies with
you never submit to it if they introduce men who appear like
gentlemen upon your vessel you cannot avoid treating them as such if
women you cannot avoid them treating them with more attention than may
be convenient because they are women but were it only in
consideration of the seasickness and its consequences can any thing
be more disagreeable than to admit people to pot and porringer with
you in a small close cabin with whom you would neither eat drink or
converse in any other place but these are not the only reasons every
gentleman going to France should avoid making new acquaintance at
Dover at Sea or at Calais many adventurers are always passing
and many honest men are often led into grievous and dangerous situations
by such inconsiderate connections nay the best and wisest men are
the most liable to be off their guard and therefore you will excuse my
pointing it out to you
I could indeed relate some alarming consequences nay some fatal ones
which have befallen men of honour and character in this country from
such unguarded connections and such as they would not have been drawn
into on the other side of the invidious Streight When an
Englishman leaves his own country and is got no further from it than to
this town he looks back upon it with an eye of partial affection no
wonder then if he feels more disposed to be kind to a countryman and a
stranger he may meet in thisI do not think it would be difficult to
point out what degree of intimacy would arise between two men who knew
but little of each other according to the part of the world they were
to meet inI remember the time when I only knew your person and
coveted your acquaintance at that time we lived in the same town knew
each others general character but passed without speaking or even the
compliment of the hat yet had we met in London we should certainly
have taken some civil notice of each other had the interview been at
York it is five to one but it would have produced a conversation at
Edinburgh or Dublin we should have dined or gone to the play
together but if we had met at Barbadoes I should have been invited to
spend a month at your PENN and experienced many of those marks of
hospitality friendship and generosity I have found from the Creoles
in general When you get upon the French coast the packet brings to
and is soon boarded by a French boat to carry the passengers on shore
this passage is much longer than it appears to be is always
disagreeable and sometimes dangerous and the landing if the water be
very low intolerable in this case never mind the advice of the
Captain his advice is and must be regulated by his own and his
owners interest more than your convenience therefore stay on board
till there is water enough to sail up to the town and be landed by a
plank laid from the packet to the shore and do not suffer any body to
persuade you to go into a boat or to be put on shore by any other
method tho the packetmen and the Frenchmen unite to persuade you
so to do because they are mutually benefited by putting you to more
expence and the latter are entertained with seeing your cloaths
dirted or the ladies frighted If most of the packetboats are in
Calais harbour your Captain will use every argument in his power to
persuade you to go on shore in the French boat because he will in
that case return directly to Dover and thereby save eightandtwenty
shillings port duty When we came over I prevailed upon a large company
to stay on board till there was water enough to sail into the harbour
it is not in the power of the Captain to deceive you as to that matter
because there is a red flag hoisted gradually higher and higher as the
water flows into the harbour at a little fort which stands upon
stilts near the entrance of it When you are got on shore go directly
to Desseins and be in no trouble about your baggage horses or
coach the former will be all carried by men appointed for that
purpose safely to the Customhouse and the latter wheeled up to your
Hotel where you will sit down more quietly and be entertained more
decently than at Dover
LETTER IV
RHEIMS in Champagne
Little or nothing occurred to me worth remarking to you on my journey
hither but that the province of Artois is a fine corn country and
that the French farmers seem to understand that business perfectly well
I was surprised to find near St Omers large plantations of
tobacco which had all the vigour and healthy appearance of that which I
have seen grow in poor America On my way here like the countryman
in London in gazing about I missed my road but a civil and in
appearance a substantial farmer conducted us half a league over the
fields and marked out the course to get into it again without
returning directly back a circumstance I much hate though perhaps it
might have been the shorter way However before I gained the high road
I stumbled upon a private one which led us into a little village
pleasantly situated and inhabited by none other but the poorest
peasants whose tattered habits wretched houses and smiling
countenances convinced me that chearfulness and contentment shake
hands oftener under thatched than painted roofs We found one of these
villagers as ready to boil our teakettle provide butter milk c as
we were for our breakfasts and during the preparation of it I believe
every man woman and child of the hamlet was come down to look at
us for beside that wonderful curiosity common to this whole nation
the inhabitants of this village had never before seen an Englishman
they had heard indeed often of the country they said and that it was
un pays tres riche There was such a general delight in the faces of
every age and so much civility I was going to say politeness shewn
to us that I caught a temporary chearfulness in this village which I
had not felt for some months before and which I intend to carry with
me I therefore took out my guittar and played till I set the whole
assembly in motion and some in spite of their wooden shoes and others
without any danced in a manner not to be seen among our English
peasants They had shoes like a sauceboat but no steepleclockd
hose While we breakfasted one of the villagers fed my horse with some
freshmowed hay and it was with some difficulty I could prevail upon
him to be paid for it because the trifle I offered was much more than
his Court of Conscience informed him it was worth I could moralize
here a little but I will only ask you in which state think you man is
best the untaught man in that of nature or the man whose mind is
enlarged by education and a knowledge of the world The behaviour of
the inhabitants of this little hamlet had a very forcible effect upon
me because it brought me back to my earlier days and reminded me of
the reception I met with in America by what we now call the Savage
Indians yet I have been received in the same courteous manner in a
little hamlet unarmed and without any other protection but by the law
of nature by those savagesindeed it was before the Savages of
Europe had instructed them in the art of war or Mr Whitfield had
preached methodism among them Therefore I only tell you what they
were in 1735 not what they are at present When I visited them
they walked in the flowery paths of Nature now I fear they tread the
polluted roads of blood Perhaps of all the uncivilized nations under
the sun the native Indians of America were the most humane I have
seen an hundred instances of their humanity and integritywhen a white
man was under the lash of the executioner at Savannah in Georgia
for using an Indian woman ill I saw Torno Chaci their King run in
between the offender and the corrector saying whip me not
himthe King was the complainant indeed but the man deserved a
much severer chastisement This was a Savage King Christian Kings too
often care not who is whipt so they escape the smart
LETTER V
RHEIMS
We arrived at this city before the bustle which the coronation of
Louis the 16th occasioned was quite over I am sorry I did not see it
because I now find it worth seeing but I staid at Calais on purpose
to avoid it for having paid two guineas to see the coronation of George
the Third I determined never more to be put to any extraordinary
expence on the score of crowned heads However my curiosity has been
well gratified in hearing it talked over and over again and in reading
Marmontells letter to a friend upon that subject but I will not
repeat what he or others have said upon the occasion because you have
no doubt seen in the English papers a tolerably good one only that the
Queen was so overcome with the repeated shouts and plaudits of her new
subjects that she was obliged to retire The fine Gothic cathedral in
which the ceremony was performed is indeed a church worthy of such a
solemnity the portal is the finest I ever beheld the windows are
painted in the very best manner nor is there any thing within the
church but what should be there I need not tell you that this is the
province which produces the most delicious wine in the world but I will
assure you that I should have drank it with more pleasure had you been
here to have partook of it In the cellars of one winemerchant I was
conducted through long passages more like streets than caves on each
side of which bottled Champaigne was piled up some feet higher than
my head and at least twelve deep I bought two bottles to taste of
that which the merchant assured me was each of the best sort he had and
for which I paid him six livres if he sells all he had in bottles at
that time and at the same price I shall not exceed the bounds of truth
if I say I saw ten thousand pounds worth of bottled Champaigne in
his cellars Neither of the bottles however contained wine so good as
I often drank in England but perhaps we are deceived and find it more
palatable by having sugar in it for I suspect that most of the
Champaigne which is bottled for the use of English consumption is so
prepared That you may know however for the future whether Champaigne
or any other wine is so adulterated I will give you an infallible
method to provefill a small longnecked bottle with the wine you
would prove and invert the neck of it into a tumbler of clear water if
the wine be genuine it will all remain in the bottle if adulterated
with sugar honey or any other sweet substance the sweets will all
pass into the tumbler of water and leave the genuine wine behind The
difference between still Champaigne and that which is mousser is
owing to nothing more than the time of the year in which it is bottled
I found in this town an English gentleman from whom we received many
civilities and who made us acquainted with a French gentleman and lady
whose partiality to the English nation is so great that their
neighbours call their house THE ENGLISH HOTEL The partiality of such
a family is a very flattering as well as a very pleasing circumstance
to those who are so happy to be known to them because they are not only
the first people in the town but the best and in point of talents
inferior to none perhaps in the kingdom I must not after saying so
much omit to tell you it is Monsieur  Madame de Jardin of whom I
speak they live in the GRANDE PLACE visavis the statue of the
King and if ever you come to Rheims be assured you will find it a GOOD
PLACE Madame de Jardin is not only one of the highestbred women in
France but one of the first in point of letters and that is saying a
great deal for France abounds more with women of that turn than
England Mrs Macaulay Mrs Carter Miss Aikin and Mrs Montague are
the only four ladies I can recollect in England who are celebrated for
their literary genius in France I could find you a score or two To
give you some idea of the regard and affection Mons de Jardin has for
his wifefor French husbands now and then love their wives as well
as we Englishmen doI send you a line I found in his study wrote
under his ladys miniature picture
Chaque instant a mes yeux la rend
Plus estimable
This town stands in a vast plain is of great extent and enclosed
within high walls and a deep ditch The public walks are of great
extent nobly planted and the finest in the whole kingdom It is
indeed a large and opulent city and abounds not only with the best
wine but every thing that is good and every thing is plenty and
consequently cheap The fruit market in particular is superior to
every thing of the kind I ever beheld but I will not tantalize you by
saying any more upon that subject Adieu
PS The Antiquarian will find amusement in this town There are some
Roman remains worthy of notice but such as require the information of
the inhabitant to be seen
LETTER VI
DIJON
You will laugh perhaps when I tell you I could hardly refrain from
tears when I took leave of the De Jardin family at Rheimsbut so
it was Goodbreeding and attention have so much the appearance of
friendship that they may and often do deceive the most discerning
menno wonder then if I was unhappy in leaving a town where I am
sure I met with the first and had some reason to believe I should have
found the latter had we staid to cultivate it Bourgogne is however
a much finer province than Champaigne and this town is delightfully
situated that it is a cheap province you will not doubt even to
English travellers when I tell you that I had a good supper for four
persons three decent beds good hay and plenty of corn for my horse
at an inn upon this road and was charged only four livres ten sols
not quite four shillings Nor was it owing to any mistake for I lay the
following night at just such another inn and was charged just the same
price for nearly the same entertainment They were carriers inns
indeed but I know not whether they were not upon the whole better
and cleaner too than some of the town auberges I need not therefore
tell you I was straggled a little out of le Route Anglois when I
found such a bon Marche
Dijon is pleasantly situated well built and the country round about it
is as beautiful as nature could well make it The shady walks round the
whole town are very pleasing and command a view of the adjacent
country The excellence of the wine of this province you are better
acquainted with than I am though I must confess I have drank better
burgundy in England than I have yet tasted here but I am not surprized
at that for at Madeira I could not get wine that was even tolerable
I found here two genteel English gentlemen Mess Plowden and Smyth
from whom we received many marks of attention and politenessHere I
imagined I should be able to bear seeing the execution of a man whose
crimes merited I thought the severest punishment He was broke upon
the wheel so it is called but the wheel is what the body is fixed upon
to be exposed on the high road after the execution This mans body
however was burnt The miserable wretch a young strong man was
brought in the evening by a faint torch light to a chapel near the
place of execution where he might have continued in prayer till
midnight but after one hour spent there he walked to and mounted the
scaffold accompanied by his confessor who with great earnestness
continually presented to him and bade him kiss the crucifix he
carried in his hand When the prisoner came upon the scaffold he very
willingly laid himself upon his back and extended his arms and legs
over a cross that was laid flat and fixed fast upon the scaffold for
that purpose and to which he was securely tied by the executioner and
his mother who assisted her son in this horrid business Part of the
cross was cut away in eight places so as to leave a hollow vacancy
where the blows were to be given which are between the shoulder and
elbow elbow and wrist thigh and knee and knee and ancle When the man
was securely tied down the end of a rope which was round his neck with
a running noose was brought through a hole in and under the scaffold
this was to give the Coup de Grace after breaking a Coup which
relieved him and all the agitated spectators from an infinite degree
of misery except only the executioner and his mother for they both
seemed to enjoy the deadly office When the blows were given which
were made with a heavy piece of iron in the form of a butchers
cleaver without an edge the bones of the arms and legs were broke in
eight places at each blow the sufferer called out O God without
saying another word or even uttering a groan During all this time the
Confessor called upon him continually to kiss the cross and to remember
Christ his Redeemer Indeed there was infinite address as well as
piety in the conduct of the Confessor for he would not permit this
miserable wretch to have one moments reflection about his bodily
sufferings while a matter of so much more importance was depending but
even those eight blows seemed nothing to two dreadful afterclaps for
the executioner then untied the body turned his back upwards and gave
him two blows on the small of the back with the same iron weapon and
yet even that did not put an end to the life and sufferings of the
malefactor for the finishing stroke was after all this done by the
halter and then the body was thrown into a great fire and consumed to
ashes There were two or three executions soon after but of a more
moderate kind Yet I hope I need not tell you that I shall never attend
another and would feign have made my escape from this but it was
impossibleHere too I saw upwards of fourscore criminals linked
together by one long chain and so they were to continue till they
arrived in the galleys at Marseilles Now I am sure you will be as I
was astonished to think an old woman the mother of the executioner
should willingly assist in a business of so horrid a nature and I dare
