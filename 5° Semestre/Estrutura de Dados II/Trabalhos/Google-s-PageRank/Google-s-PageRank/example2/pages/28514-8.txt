On much the same principle he quietly announced that the Chinese
eat birds nests
Just what do you mean by that I demanded resenting the fact that
he could stand as silent as a December beehive before my morosely
questioning eyes
I mean that being married youve run away with the idea that all
birds nests are made out of mud and straw with possibly a garnish
of horse hairs But if youd really examine these edible nests youd
find they were made of surprisingly appealing and succulent tendrils
Theyre quite appetizing you may be sure or theyd never be eaten
I stood turning this over exactly as Ive seen my Dinkie turn over an
unexpectedly rancid nut
Arent you under the circumstances being rather stupidly clever I
finally asked
When I suppose youd rather see me cleverly stupid he found the
heart to suggest
But that woman to me always looked like a frog I protested doing
my best to duplicate his pose of impersonality
Well she doesnt make love like a frog he retorted with his first
betraying touch of anger I turned to the window to the end that my
ElizaCrossingtheIce look wouldnt be entirely at his mercy A
belated March blizzard was slapping at the panes and cuffing the
housecorners At the end of a long winter I knew tempers were apt
to be short But this was much more than a matter of barometers The
man Id wanted to live with like a second Suzanne de Sirmont in
Daudets Happiness had not only cut me to the quick but was rubbing
salt in the wound He had said what he did with deliberate intent to
hurt me for it was only too obvious that he was tired of being on the
defensive And it did hurt It couldnt help hurting For the man
after all was my husband He was the husband to whom Id given up the
best part of my life the twolegged basket into which Id packed all
my eggs of allegiance And now he was scrambling that precious
collection for a cheap omelette of amorous adventure He was my
husband I kept reminding myself But that didnt cover the entire
case No husband whose heart is right stands holding another womans
shoulder and tries to read her shoenumbers through her ardently
upturned eyes It shows the wind is not blowing right in the home
circle It shows a rent in the dyke a flaw in the blade a breach in
the fortresswall of faith For marriage to the wife who is a mother
as well impresses me as rather like the spliced arrow of the
Esquimos it is cemented together with blood It is a solemn matter
And for the sake of mutterschutz if for nothing else it must be
kept that way
There was a time I suppose when the thought of such a thing would
have taken my breath away would have chilled me to the bone But Id
been through my refining fires in that respect and you cant burn
the prairie over twice in the same season I tried to tell myself it
was the setting and not the essential fact that seemed so odious I
did my best to believe it wasnt so much that Duncan Argyll McKail had
stooped to make advances to this bandylegged sheteacher whom Id so
charitably housed at Casa Grande since the beginning of the yearfor
Id long since learned not to swallow the antique claim that of all
terrestrial carnivora only man and the lion are truly
monogamousbut more the fact it had been made such a backstairs
affair with no solitary redeeming touch of dignity
DinkyDunk I suppose would have laughed it away if I hadnt walked
in on them with their arms about each other and the bandylegged one
breathing her capitulating sighs into his ear But there was
desperation in the eyes of Miss Alsina Teeswater and it was plain to
see that if my husband had been merely playing with fire it had become
a much more serious matter with the lady in the case There was in
fact something almost dignifying in that strickenly defiant face of
hers I was almost sorry for her when she turned and walked
whitelipped out of the room What I resented most as I stood facing
my husband was his paraded casualness his refusal to take a tragic
situation tragically His attitude seemed to imply that we were about
to have a difference over a small thingover a small thing with brown
eyes He could even stand inspecting me with a mildly amused glance
and I might have forgiven his mildness I suppose if it had been
without amusement and that amusement in some way at my expense He
even managed to laugh as I stood there staring at him It was neither
an honest nor a natural laugh It merely gave me the feeling that he
was trying to entrench himself behind a raw mound of mirth that any
shelter was welcome until the barrage was lifted
And what do you intend doing about it I asked more quietly than I
had imagined possible
What would you suggest he parried as he began to feel in his
pockets for his pipe
And I still had a sense as I saw the barricaded look come into his
face of entrenchments being frantically thrown up I continued to
stare at him as he found his pipe and proceeded to fill it I even
wrung a ghostly satisfaction out of the discovery that his fingers
werent so steady as he might have wished them to be
I suppose youre trying to make me feel like the Wicked Uncle edging
away from the abandoned Babes in the Woods he finally demanded as
though exasperated by my silence He was delving for matches by this
time and seemed disappointed that none was to be found in his
pockets I dont know why he should seem to recede from me for he
didnt move an inch from where he stood with that defensively mocking
smile on his face But abysmal gulfs of space seemed to blow in like
seamists between him and me desolating and lonely stretches of
emptiness which could never again be spanned by the tiny bridges of
hope I felt alone terribly alone in a world over which the last
fire had swept and the last rains had fallen My throat tightened and
my eyes smarted from the wave of selfpity which washed through my
body It angered me ridiculously to think that I was going to break
down at such a time
But the more I thought over it the more muddled I grew There was
something maddening in the memory that I was unable to act as my
instincts prompted me to act that I couldnt like the outraged wife
of screen and story walk promptly out of the door and slam it
epochally shut after me But modern life never quite lives up to its
fiction And we are never quite free we women who have given our
hostages to fortune to do as we wish We have lives other than our
own to think about
But its all been soso dishonest I cried out stopping myself
in the middle of a gesture which might have seemed like wringing my
hands
That apparently gave DinkyDunk something to get his teeth into The
neutral look went out of his eye to be replaced by a fortifying stare
of enmity
I dont know as its any more dishonest than the longdistance brand
of the same thing
I knew at once what he meant He meant Peter He meant poor old
Peter Ketley whose weekly letter year in and year out came as
regular as clockwork to Casa Grande Those letters came to my son
Dinkie though it couldnt be denied they carried many a cheering word
and many a companionable message to Dinkies mother But it brought me
up short to think that my own husband would try to play cuttlefish
with a cleanhearted and a cleanhanded man like Peter The wave that
went through my body on this occasion was one of rage I tried to
say something but I couldnt The lion of my anger had me down by
this time with his paw on my breast The power of speech was
squeezed out of my carcass I could only stare at my husband with a
denuding and devastating stare of incredulity touched with disgust of
abhorrence skirting dangerously close along the margins of hate And
he stared back with morose and watchful defiance on his face
Heaven only knows how it would have ended if that tableau hadnt gone
smash with a sudden offstage clatter and thump and cry which reminded
me there were more people in the world than Chaddie McKail and her
philandering old husband For during that interregnum of parental
preoccupation Dinkie and Poppsy had essayed to toboggan down the lower
half of the frontstairs in an empty drawer commandeered from my
bedroom dresser Their descent apparently had been about as
precipitate as that of their equally adventurous sire down the treads
of my respect for they had landed in a heap on the hardwood floor of
the hall and I found Dinkie with an abraded shinbone and Poppsy with
a cut lip My Poppsy was more frightened at the sight of blood than
actually hurt by her fall and Dinkie betrayed a not unnatural
tendency to enlarge on his injuries in extenuation of his offense But
that suddenly imposed demand for firstaid took my mind out of the
darker waters in which it had been wallowing and by the time I had
comforted my kiddies and completed my ministrations DinkyDunk had
quietly escaped from the house and my accusatory stares by clapping on
his hat and going out to the stables
And thats the scene which keeps pacing back and forth between the
bars of my brain like a jaguar in a circuscage Thats the scene Ive
been living over for the last few days thinking of all the more
brilliant things I might have said and the more expedient things I
might have done And thats the scene which has been working like
yeast at the bottom of my sodden batter of contentment making me feel
that Id swell up and burst if all that crazy ferment couldnt find
some relief in expression So after three long years and more of
silence Im turning back to this the journal of one irresponsible old
Chaddie McKail who wanted so much to be happy and who has in some way
missed the pot of gold that they told her was to be found at the
rainbows end
It seems incredible as I look back that more than three long years
should slip away without the penning of one line in this the
safetyvalve of my soul But the impulse to write rather slipped away
from me It wasnt that there was so little to record for life is
always life But when it burns clearest it seems to have the trick of
consuming its own smoke and leaving so very little ash The crowded
even tenor of existence goes on with its tidal ups and downs too
listlessly busy to demand expression Then the shock of tempest comes
and its only after were driven out of them that we realize weve
been drifting so long in the doldrums of life Then it comes home to
us that there are the Dark Ages in the history of a woman exactly as
there were the Dark Ages in the history of Europe Life goes on in
those Dark Ages but it doesnt feel the call to articulate itself to
leave a record of its experiences And that strikes me as I sit here
and think of it as about the deepest tragedy that can overtake
anything on this earth Nothing after all is sadder than silence
the silence of dead civilizations and dead cities and dead souls And
nothing is more costly For beauty itself in actual life passes
away but beauty lovingly recorded by mortal hands endures and goes
down to our children And I stop writing at that word of children
for miraculously as I repeat it I see it cut a window in the
unlighted house of my heart And that window is the bright little
Gothic oriel which will always be golden and luminous with love and
will always send the last shadow scurrying away from the mustiest
corner of my tower of life I have my Dinkie and my Poppsy and
nothing can take them away from me Its on them that I pin my hope
Sunday the Seventeenth
Ive been thinking a great deal over whats happened this last week or
so And Ive been trying to reorganize my life the same as you put a
house to rights after a funeral But it wasnt a wellordered funeral
in this case and I was denied even the tempered satisfaction of the
bereaved after the finality of a smoothly conducted burial For
nothing has been settled Its merely that Time has been trying to
encyst what it can not absorb I felt for a day or two that I had
nothing much to live for I felt like a featherweight whod faced a
knockout I saw Pride go to the mat and take the count and if I was
dazed for a while I suppose it was mostly convalescence from shock
Then I tightened my belt and reminded myself that it wasnt the first
wallop Fate had given me and remembered that in this life you have to
adjust yourself to your environment or be eliminated from the game
And life I suppose has tamed me as a man who once loved me said it
would do The older I get the more tolerant I try to be and the more
I know of this world the more I realize that Right is seldom all on
one side and Wrong on the other Its a matter of give and take this
problem of traveling in doubleharness I can even smile a little as
I remember that college day in my teens when MatildaAnne and Katrina
and FannyRainintheFace and myself solemnly discussed man and his
makeup over a threepound box of Maillards and resolutely agreed
that we would surrender our hearts to no suitor over twentysix and
marry no male whod ever loved another womannot at least unless
the situation had become compensatingly romanticized by the death of
any such lady preceding us in our loved ones favor Little we knew of
men and ourselves and the humiliations with which life breaks the
spirit of arrogant youth For even now knowing what I know Ive been
doing my best to cooper together a case for my unstable old
DinkyDunk Ive been trying to keep the thought of poor dead Lady
Alicia out of my head Ive been wondering if theres any truth in
what DinkyDunk said a few weeks ago about a mere father being like
the male of the warriorspider whom the female of the species stands
ready to dine upon once shes assured of her progeny
I suppose I have given most of my time and attention to my children
And its as perilous I suppose to give your heart to a man and then
take it even partly away again as it is to give a trellis to a
rosebush and then expect it to stand alone My husband too has been
restless and dissatisfied with prairie life during the last year or
so has been rocking in his own doldrums of inertia where the sight of
even the humblest shipand the Wandering Sail in this case always
seemed to me as soft and shapeless as a boned squabpigeoncould
promptly elicit an answering signal
But I strike a snag there for Alsina has not been so boneless as I
anticipated There was an unlookedfor intensity in her eyes and a
mild sort of tragedy in her voice when she came and told me that she
was going to another school in the KneeHill country and asked if I
could have her taken in to Buckhorn the next morning Some one of
course had to go There was one too many in this prairie home that
must always remain so like an island dotting the lonely wastes of a
lonely sea And triangles oddly enough seem to flourish best in city
squares But much as I wanted to talk to Alsina I was compelled to
respect her reserve I even told her that Dinkie would miss her a
great deal She replied with a choke in her voice that he was a
wonderful child That of course was music to the ears of his mother
and my respect for the tremulous Miss Teeswater went up at least ten
degrees But when she added without meeting my eye that she was
really fond of the boy I couldnt escape the impression that she was
edging out on very thin ice It was I think only the silent misery
in her halfaverted face which kept me from inquiring if she hadnt
rather made it a family affair But that second thought promptly told
me would seem too much like striking the fallen And we both seemed
to feel thereafter that silence was best
Practically nothing passed between us in fact until we reached the
station I could see that she was dreading the ordeal of saying
goodby That unnamed sixth sense peculiar to cabdrivers and waiters
and married women told me that every moment on the bald little
platform was being a torture to her As the big engine came lumbering
up to a standstill she gave me one quick and searching look It was a
look I shall never forget For in it was a question and something
more than a question An unworded appeal was there and also an
unworded protest It got past my outposts of reason in some way It
came to me in my bitterness like the smell of lilacs into a sickroom
I couldnt be cruel to that poor crushed outcast who had suffered
quite as much from the whole ignoble affair as I had suffered I
suddenly held out my hand to her and she took it with that hungry
questioning look still on her face
Its all right I started to say But her head suddenly went down
between her hunchedup shoulders Her body began to shake and tears
gushed from her eyes I had to help her to the car steps
It was all my fault she said in a strangled voice between her
helpless little sobs
It was brave of her of course and she meant it for the best But I
wish she hadnt said it Instead of making everything easier for me
as she intended she only made it harder She left me disturbingly
conscious of ghostly heroisms which transposed what I had tried to
regard as essentially ignoble into some higher and purer key And she
made it harder for me to look at my husband when I got home with a
calm and collected eye I felt suspiciously like Lady Macbeth after
the second murder I felt that we were fellowsharers of a guilty
secret it would never do to drag too often into the light of
everyday life
But it will no more stay under cover I find than a dabchick will
stay under water It bobs up in the most unexpected places as it did
last night when Dinkie publicly proclaimed that he was going to marry
his Mummy when he got big
It would be well my son not to repeat the mistakes of your father
observed DinkyDunk And having said it he relighted his quarantining
pipe and refused to meet my eye But it didnt take a surgical
operation to get what he meant into my head It hurt in more ways
than one for it struck me as suspiciously like a stone embodied in a
snowballand even our offspring recognized this as no fair manner of
fighting
Then it impresses you as a mistake I demanded seeing red for the
coyote in me Im afraid will never entirely become housedog
Isnt that the way you regard it he asked inspecting me with a
noncommittal eye
I had to bite my lip to keep from flinging out at him the things that
were huddled back in my heart But it was no time for making big war
medicine So I got the lid on and held it there
My dear DinkyDunk I said with an effort at a gesture of weariness
Ive long since learned that life cant be made clean like a cats
body by the use of the tongue alone
DinkyDunk did not look at me Instead he turned to the boy who was
watching that scene with a small frown of perplexity on his none too
approving face
You go up to the nursery commanded my husband with more curtness
than usual
But before Dinkie went he slowly crossed the room and kissed me He
did so with a quiet resoluteness which was not without its tacit touch
of challenge
You may feel that way about the use of the tongue said my husband
as soon as we were alone but Im going to unload a few things Ive
been keeping under cover
He waited for me to say something But I preferred remaining silent
Of course he floundered on I dont want to stop you martyrizing
yourself in making a mountain out of a molehill But Im getting a
trifle tired of this holierthanthou attitude And
And I prompted when he came to a stop and sat pushing up his
brindled fronthair until it made me think of the Corean lion on the
library mantel the lion in pottery which we invariably spoke of as
the Dog of Fo My wintry smile at that resemblance seemed to
exasperate him
What were you going to say I quietly inquired
Oh hell he exclaimed with quite unexpected vigor
I hope the children are out of hearing I reminded him
solemneyed
Yes the children he cried catching at the word exactly as a
drowning man catches at a lifebelt The children Thats just the
root of the whole intolerable situation This hasnt been a home for
the last three or four years its been nothing but a nursery And
about all Ive been is a retriever for a creche a clodhopper to
tiptoe about the sacred circle and see to it theres enough flannel to
cover their backs and enough food to put into their stomachs Im an
accident of course an intruder to be faced with fortitude and borne
with patience
This sounds quite disturbing I interrupted It almost leaves me
suspicious that you are about to emulate the rabbit and devour your
young
DinkyDunk fixed me with an accusatory finger
And the fact that you can get humor out of it shows me just how far
it has gone he cried with a bitterness which quickly enough made me
sober again And I could stand being deliberately shut out of your
life and shut out of their lives as far as you can manage it but I
cant see that its doing either them or you any particular good
But I am responsible for the way in which those children grow up I
said quite innocent of the double entendre which brought a dark
flush to my husbands none too happy face
And I suppose Im not to contaminate them he demanded
Havent you done enough along that line I asked
He swung about at that with something dangerously like hate on his
face
Whose children are they he challenged
You are their father I quietly acknowledged It rather startled me
to find DinkyDunk regarding himself as a fur coat and my offspring as
motheggs which I had laid deep in the pelt of his life where we were
slowly but surely eating the glory out of that garment and leaving it
as bald as a prairie dogs belly
Well you give very little evidence of it
You cant expect me to turn a cartwheel surely every time I
remember it was my none too gracious inquiry Then I sat down But
what is it you want me to do I asked as I sat studying his face
and I felt sorriest for him because he felt sorry for himself
Thats exactly the point he averred There doesnt seem anything
to do But this cant go on forever
No I acknowledged It seems too much like history repeating
itself
His head went down at that and it was quite a long time before he
looked up at me again
I dont suppose you can see it from my side of the fence he asked
with a disturbing new note of humility in his voice
Not when you force me to stay on the fence I told him He seemed to
realize as he sat there slowly moving his head up and down that no
further advance was to be made along that line So he took a deep
breath and sat up
Something will have to be done about getting a new teacher for that
school he said with an appositeness which was only too painfully
apparent
Ive already spoken to two of the trustees I told him Theyre
getting a teacher from the Peg Its to be a man this time
Instead of meeting my eye he merely remarked Thatll be better for
the boy
In what way I inquired
Because I dont think too much petticoat is good for any boy
responded my lord and master
Big or little I couldnt help amending in spite of all my good
intentions
DinkyDunk ignored the thrust though it plainly took an effort
There are times when even kindness can be a sort of cruelty he
patiently and somewhat platitudinously pursued
Then I wish somebody would illtreat me along that line I
interjected And this time he smiled though it was only for a
moment
Supposing we stick to the children he suggested
Of course I agreed And since youve brought the matter up I cant
help telling you that I always felt that my love for my children is
the one redeeming thing in my life
Thanks said my husband with a wince
Please dont misunderstand me Im merely trying to say that a
mothers love for her children has to be one of the strongest and
holiest things in this hard old world of ours And it seems only
natural to me that a woman should consider her children first and
plan for them and make sacrifices for them and fight for them if she
has to
Its so natural in fact remarked DinkyDunk that it has been
observed in even the Bengal tigress
It is my turn to thank you I acknowledged after giving his
statement a moment or two of thought
But were getting away from the point again proclaimed my husband
Ive been trying to tell you that children are like rabbits Its
only fit and proper they should be cared for but they cant thrive
and they cant even live if theyre handled too much
I havent observed any alarming absence of health in my children I
found the courage to say But a tightness gathered about my heart for
I could sniff what was coming
They may be all right as far as that goes persisted their lordly
parent But what I say is too much cuddling and mollycoddling isnt
good for that boy of yours or anybody elses boy And he proceeded
to explain that my Dinkie was an ordinary everyday normal child
and should be accepted and treated as such or wed have a
temperamental little bounder on our hands
I knew that my boy wasnt abnormal But I knew on the other hand
that he was an exceptionally impressionable and sensitive child And I
couldnt be sorry for that for if theres anything I abhor in this
world its torpor And whatever he may have been nothing could shake
me in my firm conviction that a childs own mother is the best person
to watch over his growth and shape his character
But what is all this leading up to I asked steeling myself for the
unwelcome
Simply to what Ive already told you on several occasions was my
husbands answer That its about time this boy of ours was bundled
off to a boardingschool
I sat back trying to picture my home and my life without Dinkie But
it was unbearable It was unthinkable
I shall never agree to that I quietly retorted
Why asked my husband with a note of triumph which I resented
For one thing because he is still a child because he is too young
I contended knowing that I could never agree with DinkyDunk in his
thoroughly English ideas of education even while I remembered how he
had once said that the greatness of England depended on her
publicschools such as Harrow and Eton and Rugby and Winchester and
that she had been the best colonizer in the world because her boys had
been taken young and taught not to overvalue home ties had been made
manlier by getting off with their own kind instead of remaining
hitched to an apronstring
And you prefer keeping him stuck out here on the prairie demanded
DinkyDunk
The prairie has been good enough for his parents this last seven or
eight years I contended
It hasnt been good enough for me my husband cried out with quite
unlookedfor passion And Ive about had my fill of it
Where would you prefer going I asked trying to speak as quietly as
I could
Thats something Im going to find out as soon as the chance comes
he retorted with a slow and embittered emphasis which didnt add any
to my peace of mind
Then why cross our bridges I suggested until we come to them
But youre not looking for bridges he challenged You dont want
to see anything beyond living like Doukhobours out here on the edge of
Nowhere and remembering that youve got your precious offspring here
under your wing and wondering how many bushels of NumberOneHard it
will take to buy your Dinkie a riding pinto
Arent you rather tired tonight I asked with all the patience I
could command
Yes and Im talking about the thing that makes me tired For you
know as well as I do that youve made that boy of yours a sort of
anesthetic You put him on like a nosecap and forget the world Hes
about all you remember to think about Why when you look at the
clock nowadays it isnt ten minutes to twelve Its always Dinkie
minutes to Dink When you read a book youre only reading about what
your Dinkie might have done or what your Dinkie is some day to write
When you picture the Prime Minister its merely your Dinkie grown big
laying down the law to a House of Parliament made up of other Dinkies
rows and rows of em When the sun shines youre wondering whether
its warm enough for your Dinkie to walk in and when the snow begins
to melt youre wondering whether its soft enough for the beloved
Dinkie to mold into snowballs When you see a girl you at once get
busy speculating over whether or not shell ever be beautiful enough
for your Dinkie and when one of the Crowned Heads of Europe announces
the alliance of its youngest princess you fall to pondering if Dinkie
wouldnt have made her a better husband And when the flowers come out
in your windowbox you wonder if theyre fair enough to bloom beside
your Dinkie I dont suppose I ever made a haystack that you didnt
wonder whether it wasnt going to be a grand place for Dinkie to slide
down And when Dinkie draws a goggleeyed man on his scribbler you see
Michael Angelo totter and Titian turn in his grave And when Dinkie
writes a composition of thirty crooked lines on the landing of Hengist
you feel that fate did Hume a mean trick in letting him pass away
before inspecting that final word in historical record And heavens
just a row of Dinkies with little gold harps tucked under their wings
And you think youre breathing air but all youre breathing is
Dinkies millions and millions of etherealized Dinkies And when you
read about the famine in China you inevitably and adroitly hitch the
death of seven thousand Chinks in Yangchow on to the interests of
your immortal offspring And I suppose Rome really came into being for
the one ultimate end that an immortal young Dinkie might possess his
full degree of Dinkiness and the glory that was Greece must have been
merely the tomtoms tuning up for the finished dance of our Dinkies
grandeur Day and night its Dinkie just Dinkie
I waited until he was through I waited heavy of heart until his
foolish fires of revolt had burned themselves out And it didnt seem
to add to his satisfaction to find that I could inspect him with a
quiet and slightly commiserative eye
You are accusing me I finally told him of something Im proud of
And Im afraid Ill always be guilty of caring for my own son
He turned on me with a sort of heavy triumph
Well its something that youll jolly well pay the piper for some
