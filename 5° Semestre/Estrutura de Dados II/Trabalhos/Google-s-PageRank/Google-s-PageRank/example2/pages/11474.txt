I walked up and down agin thinking  If he adnt and it was found out
it would blacken his good name and break is pore wifes art  Thats
the way I looked at it and for his sake and er sake I determined to
stick to it
I felt appier in my mind when I ad decided on that and I went round to
the Bears Head and ad a pint  Arter that I ad another and then I
come back to the wharf and put the watch and chain on and went on with my
work
Every time I looked down at the chain on my waistcoat it reminded me of
Sam  I looked on to the river and thought of im going down on the ebb
Then I got a sort o lonesome feeling standing on the end of the jetty
all alone and I went back to the Bears Head and ad another pint
They didnt find the body and I was amost forgetting about Sam when one
evening as I was sitting on a box waiting to get my breath back to ave
another go at sweeping Joe Peel Sams mate came on to the wharf to see
me
He came in a mysterious sort o way that I didnt like looking beind
im as though he was afraid of being follered and speaking in a whisper
as if e was afraid of being heard  He wasnt a man I liked and I was
glad that the watch and chain was stowed safe away in my trowsispocket
Ive ad a shock watchman he ses
Oh I ses
A shock wots shook me all up he ses working up a shiver  Ive seen
something wot I thought people never could see and wot I never want to
see agin  Ive seen Sam
I thought a bit afore I spoke  Why I thought he was drownded I ses
So e is ses Joe  When I say Ive seen im I mean that I ave seen
his ghost
He began to shiver agin all over
Wot was it like  I ses very calm
Like Sam he ses rather short
When was it I ses
Last night at a quarter to twelve he ses  It was standing at my
front door waiting for me
And ave you been shivering like that ever since I ses
Worse than that ses Joe looking at me very ard  Its wearing off
now  The ghost gave me a message for you
I put my and in my trowsispocket and looked at im  Then I walked very
slow towards the gate
It gave me a message for you ses Joe walking beside me  We was
always pals Joe it ses you and me and I want you to pay up
fifteen bob for me wot I borrowed off of Bill the watchman  I cant rest
until its paid it ses  So heres the fifteen bob watchman
He put his and in is pocket and takes out fifteen bob and olds it out
to me
No no I ses  I cant take your money Joe Peel  It wouldnt be
right  Pore Sam is welcome to the fifteen bobI dont want it
You must take it ses Joe  The ghost said if you didnt it would come
to me agin and agin till you did and I cant stand any more of it
I cant elp your troubles I ses
You must ses Joe  Give Bill the fifteen bob it ses and hell
give you a gold watch and chain wot I gave im to mind till it was
paid
I see his little game then  Gold watch and chain I ses laughing
You must ha misunderstood it Joe
I understood it right enough ses Joe getting a bit closer to me as I
stepped outside the gate  Heres your fifteen bob are you going to
give me that watch and chain
Sartainly not I ses  I dont know wot you mean by a watch and chain
If I ad it and I gave it to anybody I should give it to Sams widder
not to you
Its nothing to do with er ses Joe very quick  Sam was most
pertikler about that
I expect you dreamt it all I ses  Where would pore Sam get a gold
watch and chain from  And why should e go to you about it  Why didnt
e come to me  If e thinks I ave got it let im come to me
All right Ill go to the policestation ses Joe
Ill come with you I ses  But eres a policeman coming along
Lets go to im
I moved towards im but Joe hung back and arter using one or two words
that would ha made any ghost ashamed to know im he sheered off  I ad
a word or two with the policeman about the weather and then I went
inside and locked the gate
My idea was that Sam ad told Joe about the watch and chain afore he fell
overboard  Joe was a nasty customer and I could see that I should ave
to be a bit careful  Some men might ha told the police about itbut I
never cared much for them  Theyre like kids in a way always asking
questionsmost of which you cant answer
It was a little bit creepy all alone on the wharf that night  I dont
deny it  Twice I thought I eard something coming up on tiptoe behind
me  The second time I was so nervous that I began to sing to keep my
spirits up and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan
Emily wot was lying alongside came up from the focsle and offered to
fight me  I was thankful when daylight came
Five nights arterwards I ad the shock of my life  It was the fust night
for some time that there was no craft up  A dark night and a nasty
moaning sort of a wind  I ad just lighted the lamp at the corner of the
warehouse wot ad blown out and was sitting down to rest afore putting
the ladder away when I appened to look along the jetty and saw a head
coming up over the edge of it  In the light of the lamp I saw the dead
white face of Sam Bullets ghost making faces at me
Illustration IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP I SAW THE DEAD WHITE FACE
I just caught my breath sharp like and then turned and ran for the
gate like a racehorse  I ad left the key in the padlock in case of
anything happening and I just gave it one turn flung the wicket open
and slammed it in the ghosts face and tumbled out into the road
I ran slap into the arms of a young policeman wot was passing  Nasty
shorttempered chap he was but I dont think I was more glad to see
anybody in my life  I hugged im till e nearly lost is breath and
then he sat me down on the kerbstone and asked me wot I meant by it
Wot with the excitement and the running I couldnt speak at fust and
when I did he said I was trying to deceive im
There aint no such thing as ghosts he ses youve been drinking
It came up out o the river and run arter me like the wind I ses
Why didnt it catch you then he ses looking me up and down and all
round about  Talk sense
He went up to the gate and peeped in and arter watching a moment
stepped inside and walked down the wharf with me follering  It was my
dooty besides I didnt like being left all alone by myself
Twice we walked up and down and all over the wharf  He flashed his
lantern into all the dark corners into empty barrels and boxes and then
he turned and flashed it right into my face and shook his ead at me
Youve been having a bit of a lark with me he ses and for two pins
Id take you  Mind if you say a word about this to anybody I will
He stalked off with his ead in the air and left me all alone in charge
of a wharf with a ghost on it  I stayed outside in the street of
course but every now and then I fancied I heard something moving about
the other side of the gate and once it was so distinct that I run along
to the Bears Head and knocked em up and asked them for a little brandy
for illness
I didnt get it of course I didnt expect to but I ad a little
conversation with the landlord from is bedroomwinder that did me more
good than the brandy would ha done  Once or twice I thought he would
ave fallen out and many a man has ad his licence taken away for less
than a quarter of wot e said to me that night  Arter he thought he ad
finished and was going back to bed agin I pointed out to im that he
adnt kissed me good night and if it adnt ha been for is missis
and two grownup daughters and the potman I believe hed ha talked to me
till daylight
Ow I got through the rest of the night I dont know  It seemed to be
twenty nights instead of one but the day came at last and when the
hands came on at six oclock they found the gate open and me on dooty
same as usual
I slept like a tired child when I got ome and arter a steak and onions
for dinner I sat down and lit my pipe and tried to think wot was to be
done  One thing I was quite certain about I wasnt going to spend
another night on that wharf alone
I went out arter a bit as far as the Clarendon Arms for a breath of
fresh air and I ad just finished a pint and was wondering whether I
ought to ave another when Ted Dennis came in and my mind was made up
He ad been in the Army all is life and so far he ad never seen
anything that ad frightened im  Ive seen him myself take on men twice
is size just for the love of the thing and arter knocking them silly
stand em a pint out of is own pocket  When I asked im whether he was
afraid of ghosts he laughed so ard that the landlord came from the other
end of the bar to see wot was the matter
I stood Ted a pint and arter he ad finished it I told im just how
things was  I didnt say anything about the watch and chain because
there was no need to and when we came outside agin I ad engaged an
assistantwatchman for ninepence a night
All youve got to do I ses is to keep me company  You neednt turn
up till eight oclock of a night and you can leave arf an hour afore me
in the morning
Righto ses Ted  And if I see the ghost Ill make it wish it ad
never been born
It was a load off my mind and I went ome and ate a tea that made my
missis talk about the workouse and orstritches in uman shape wot would
eat a woman out of ouse and ome if she would let em
I got to the wharf just as it was striking six and at a quarter to seven
the wicket was pushed open gentle and the ugly ead of Mr Joe Peel was
shoved inside
Hullo I ses  Wot do you want
I want to save your life he ses in a solemn voice  You was within a
inch of death last night watchman
Oh I ses carelesslike  Ow do you know
The ghost o Sam Bullet told me ses Joe  Arter it ad chased you up
the wharf screaming for elp it came round and told me all about it
It seems fond of you I ses  I wonder why
It was in a terrible temper ses Joe and its face was awful to look
at  Tell the watchman it ses that if he dont give you the watch
and chain I shall appear to im agin and kill im
All right I ses looking behind me to where three of the ands of the
Daisy was sitting on the focsle smoking  Ive got plenty of company
tonight
Company wont save you ses Joe  For the last time are you going to
give me that watch and chain or not  Heres your fifteen bob
No I ses even if I ad got it I shouldnt give it to you and its
no use giving it to the ghost because being made of air he asnt got
anywhere to put it
Very good ses Joe giving me a black look  Ive done all I can to
save you but if you wont listen to sense you wont  Youll see Sam
Bullet agin and youll not ony lose the watch and chain but your life
as well
All right I ses and thank you kindly but Ive got an assistant as
it appensa man wot wants to see a ghost
An assistant ses Joe staring
An old soldier I ses  A man wot likes trouble and danger  His idea
is to shoot the ghost and see wot appens
Shoot ses Joe  Shoot a pore armless ghost  Does he want to be
ung  Aint it enough for a pore man to be drownded but wot you must
try and shoot im arterwards  Why you ought to be ashamed o yourself
Wheres your art
It wont be shot if it dont come on my wharf I ses  Though I dont
mind if it does when Ive got somebody with me  I aint afraid of
anything living and I dont mind ghosts when theres two of us  Besides
which the noise of the pistol ll wake up arf the river
You take care you dont get woke up ses Joe ardly able to speak for
temper
He went off stamping and grinding is teeth and at eight oclock to the
minute Ted Dennis turned up with is pistol and helped me take care of
the wharf  Happy as a skylark e was and to see him iding behind a
barrel with his pistol ready waiting for the ghost amost made me
forget the expense of it all
It never came near us that night and Ted was a bit disappointed next
morning as he took is ninepence and went off  Next night was the same
and the next and then Ted gave up hiding on the wharf for it and sat
and snoozed in the office instead
A week went by and then another and still there was no sign of Sam
Bullets ghost or Joe Peel and every morning I ad to try and work up a
smile as I shelled out ninepence for Ted  It nearly ruined me and
worse than that I couldnt explain why I was short to the missis  Fust
of all she asked me wot I was spending it on then she asked me who I was
spending it on  It nearly broke up my omeshe did smash one kitchen
chair and a vase off the parlour mantelpiecebut I wouldnt tell er
and then led away by some men on strike at Smiths wharf Ted went on
strike for a bob a night
That was arter he ad been with me for three weeks and when Saturday
came of course I was more short than ever and people came and stood at
their doors all the way down our street to listen to the missis taking my
character away
I stood it as long as I could and then when er back was turned for
arf a moment I slipped out  While shed been talking Id been
thinking and it came to me clear as daylight that there was no need for
me to sacrifice myself any longer looking arter a dead mans watch and
chain
I didnt know exactly where Joe Peel lived but I knew the part and
arter peeping into seven publicouses I see the man I wanted sitting by
imself in a little bar  I walked in quietlike and sat down opposite
im
Morning I ses
Joe Peel grunted
Ave one with me I ses
He grunted agin but not quite so fierce and I fetched the two pints
from the counter and took a seat alongside of im
Ive been looking for you I ses
Oh he ses looking me up and down and all over  Well youve found
me now
I want to talk to you about the ghost of pore Sam Bullet I ses
Joe Peel put is mug down sudden and looked at me fierce  Look ere
Dont you come and try to be funny with me he ses  Cos I wont ave
it
I dont want to be funny I ses  Wot I want to know is are you in
the same mind about that watch and chain as you was the other day
He didnt seem to be able to speak at fust but arter a time e gives a
gasp  Woes the game  he ses
Wot I want to know is if I give you that watch and chain for fifteen
bob will that keep the ghost from anging round my wharf agin  I ses
Why o course he ses staring but you aint been seeing it agin
ave you
Ive not and I dont want to I ses  If it wants you to ave the
watch and chain give me the fifteen bob and its yours
He looked at me for a moment as if he couldnt believe is eyesight and
then e puts his and into is trowsispocket and pulls out one shilling
and fourpence arf a claypipe and a bit o leadpencil
Thats all Ive got with me he ses  Ill owe you the rest  You
ought to ha took the fifteen bob when I ad it
There was no elp for it and arter making im swear to give me the rest
o the money when e got it and that I shouldnt see the ghost agin I
anded the things over to im and came away  He came to the door to see
me off and if ever a man looked puzzled e did  Pleased at the same
time
It was a load off of my mind  My conscience told me Id done right and
arter sending a little boy with a note to Ted Dennis to tell im not to
come any more I felt appier than I ad done for a long time  When I
got to the wharf that evening it seemed like a diffrent place and I was
whistling and smiling over my work quite in my old way when the young
policeman passed
Hullo   he ses  Ave you seen the ghost agin
I ave not I ses drawing myself up Ave you
No he ses
We missed it
Missed it I ses staring at im
Yes he ses nodding  The day arter you came out screaming and
cuddling me like a frightened baby it shipped as AB on the barque
Ocean King for Valparaiso  We missed it by a few hours  Next time you
see a ghost knock it down fust and go and cuddle the police arterwards
