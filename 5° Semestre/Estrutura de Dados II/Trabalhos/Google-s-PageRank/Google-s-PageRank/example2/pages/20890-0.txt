Biography
George Chapman was probably born in the year after Elizabeths
accession Anthony Wood gives 1557 as the date but the inscription on
his portrait prefixed to the edition of The Whole Works of Homer in
1616 points to 1559 He was a native of Hitchin in Hertfordshire as we
learn from an allusion in his poem EuthymiA Raptus or The Teares of
Peace and from W Brownes reference to him in Britannias Pastorals
as the learned shepheard of faire Hitching Hill According to Wood in
1574 or thereabouts he being well grounded in school learning was sent
to the University Wood is uncertain whether he went first to Oxford or
to Cambridge but he is sure though he gives no authority for the
statement that Chapman spent some time at the former where he was
observed to be most excellent in the Latin  Greek tongues but not in
logic or philosophy and therefore I presume that that was the reason
why he took no degree there
His life for almost a couple of decades afterwards is a blank though it
has been conjectured on evidences drawn from The Shadow of Night and
Alphonsus Emperor of Germany respectively that he served in one of
Sir F Veres campaigns in the Netherlands and that he travelled in
Germany The Shadow of Night consisting of two poeticall hymnes
appeared in 1594 and is his first extant work It was followed in 1595
by Ovids Banquet of Sence The Amorous Zodiac and other poems
These early compositions while containing fine passages are obscure
and crabbed in stylev1 In 1598 appeared Marlowes fragmentary Hero
and Leander with Chapmans continuation By this year he had
established his position as a playwright for Meres in his Palladis
Tamia praises him both as a writer of tragedy and of comedy We know
from Henslowes Diary that his earliest extant comedy The Blinde
Begger of Alexandria was produced on February 12 1596 and that for
the next two or three years he was working busily for this enterprising
manager An Humerous dayes Myrth pr 1599 and All Fooles pr
1605 under the earlier title of The World Runs on Wheelsvi1 were
composed during this period
Meanwhile he had begun the work with which his name is most closely
linked his translation of Homer The first instalment entitled Seaven
Bookes of the Iliades of Homere Prince of Poets was published in
1598 and was dedicated to the Earl of Essex After the Earls execution
Chapman found a yet more powerful patron for as we learn from the
letters printed recently in The AthenAum cf Bibliography sec
III he was appointed about 1604 sewer i e cupbearer in ordinary
to Prince Henry eldest son of James I The Prince encouraged him to
proceed with his translation and about 1609 appeared the first twelve
books of the Iliad including the seven formerly published with a
fine Epistle Dedicatory to the highborn Prince of men Henry In
1611 the version of the Iliad was completed and that of the Odyssey
was at Prince Henrys desire now taken in hand But the untimely death
of the Prince on November 6th 1612 dashed all Chapmans hopes of
receiving the anticipated reward of his labours According to a petition
which he addressed to the Privy Council the Prince had promised him on
the conclusion of his translation A300 and uppon his deathbed a good
pension during my life Not only were both of these withheld but he
was deprived of his post of sewer by Prince Charles Nevertheless he
completed the version of the Odyssey in 1614 and in 1616 he published
a folio volume entitled The Whole Works of Homer The translation in
spite of its inaccuracies and its conceits is by virtue of its
sustained dignity and vigour one of the noblest monuments of
Elizabethan genius
By 1605 if not earlier Chapman had resumed his work for the stage In
that year he wrote conjointly with Marston and Jonson the comedy of
Eastward Hoe On account of some passages reflecting on the Scotch
the authors were imprisoned The details of the affair are obscure
According to Jonson in his conversation later with Drummond Chapman
and Marston were responsible for the obnoxious passages and he
voluntarily imprisoned himself with them But in one of the recently
printed letters which apparently refers to this episode Chapman
declares that he and Jonson lie under the Kings displeasure for two
clawses and both of them not our owne i e apparently written by
Marstonvii1 However this may be the offenders were soon released
and Chapman continued energetically his dramatic work In 1606 appeared
two of his most elaborate comedies The Gentleman Usher and Monsieur
DOlive and in the next year was published his first and most
successful tragedy Bussy DAmbois In 1608 were produced two
connected plays The Conspiracie and Tragedie of Charles Duke of
Byron dealing with recent events in France and based upon materials
in E Grimestons translation 1607 of Jean de Serres History Again
Chapman found himself in trouble with the authorities for the French
ambassador offended by a scene in which Henry IVs Queen was introduced
in unseemly fashion had the performance of the plays stopped for a
time Chapman had to go into hiding to avoid arrest and when he came
out he had great difficulty in getting the plays licensed for
publication even with the omission of the offending episodes His
fourth tragedy based on French history The Revenge of Bussy DAmbois
appeared in 1613 It had been preceded by two comedies MayDay
1611 and The Widdowes Teares 1612 Possibly as Mr Dobell
suggests AthenAum 23 March 1901 the coarse satire of the latter
play may have been due to its authors annoyance at the apparent refusal
of his suit by a widow to whom some of the recently printed letters are
addressed In 1613 he produced his Maske of the Middle Temple and
Lyncolns Inne which was one of the series performed in honour of the
marriage of the Princess Elizabeth and the Elector Palatine Another
hymeneal work produced on a much less auspicious occasion was an
allegorical poem Andromeda Liberata celebrating the marriage of the
Earl of Somerset with the divorced Lady Essex in December 1613
The year 1614 when the Odyssey was completed marks the culminating
point of Chapmans literary activity Henceforward partly perhaps owing
to the disappointment of his hopes through Prince Henrys death his
production was more intermittent Translations of the Homeric Hymns
of the Georgicks of Hesiod and other classical writings mainly
occupy the period till 1631 In that year he printed another tragedy
CAsar and Pompey which however as we learn from the dedication had
been written long since The remaining plays with which his name has
been connected did not appear during his lifetime A comedy The Ball
licensed in 1632 but not published till 1639 has the names of Chapman
and Shirley on the titlepage but the latter was certainly its main
author Another play however issued in the same year and ascribed to
the same hands The Tragedie of Chabot Admiral of France makes the
impression from its subjectmatter and its style of being chiefly due
to Chapman In 1654 two tragedies Alphonsus Emperour of Germany and
The Revenge for Honour were separately published under Chapmans
name Their authorship however is doubtful There is nothing in the
style or diction of Alphonsus which resembles Chapmans undisputed
work and it is hard to believe that he had a hand in it The Revenge
for Honour is on an Oriental theme entirely different from those
handled by Chapman in his other tragedies and the versification is
marked by a greater frequency of feminine endings than is usual with
him but phrases and thoughts occur which may be paralleled from his
plays and the work may be from his hand
On May 12 1634 he died and was buried in the churchyard of St
Giless in the Field where his friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to
his memory According to Wood he was a person of most reverend aspect
religious and temperate qualities rarely meeting in a poet Though his
material success seems to have been small he gained the friendship of
many of the most illustrious spirits of his timeEssex Prince Henry
Bacon Jonson Webster among the numberand it has been his good
fortune to draw in after years splendid tributes from such successors in
the poetic art as Keats and A C Swinburne

Introduction
The group of Chapmans plays based upon recent French history to which
Bussy DAmbois and its sequel belong forms one of the most unique
memorials of the Elizabethan drama The playwrights of the period were
profoundly interested in the annals of their own country and exploited
them for the stage with a magnificent indifference to historical
accuracy Gorboduc and Locrine were as real to them as any Lancastrian
or Tudor prince and their reigns were made to furnish salutary lessons
to sixteenth century magistrates Scarcely less interesting were the
heroes of republican Greece and Rome CAsar Pompey and Antony decked
out in Elizabethan garb were as familiar to the playgoers of the time
as their own national heroes real or legendary But the contemporary
history of continental states had comparatively little attraction for
the dramatists of the period and when they handled it they usually had
some political or religious end in view Under a thin veil of allegory
Lyly in Midas gratified his audience with a scathing denunciation of
the ambition and goldhunger of Philip II of Spain and half a century
later Middleton in a still bolder and more transparent allegory The
Game of Chess dared to ridicule on the stage Philips successor and
his envoy Gondomar But both plays were suggested by the elements of
friction in the relations of England and Spain
French history also supplied material to some of the London
playwrights but almost exclusively as it bore upon the great conflict
between the forces of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism The Masaker
of France which Henslowe mentions as having been played on January 3
15923 may or may not be identical with Marlowes The Massacre at
Paris printed towards the close of the sixteenth century but in all
probability it expressed similarly the burning indignation of Protestant
England at the appalling events of the Eve of St Bartholomew Whatever
Marlowes religious or irreligious views may have been he acted on this
occasion as the mouthpiece of the vast majority of his countrymen and
he founded on recent French history a play which with all its defects
is of special interest to our present inquiry For Chapman who finished
Marlowes incompleted poem Hero and Leander must have been familiar
with this drama which introduced personages and events that were partly
to reappear in the two Bussy plays A brief examination of The
Massacre at Paris will therefore help to throw into relief the
special characteristics of Chapmans dramas
It opens with the marriage in 1572 of Henry of Navarre and Margaret
sister of King Charles IX which was intended to assuage the religious
strife But the Duke of Guise the protagonist of the play is
determined to counterwork this policy and with the aid of Catherine de
Medicis the QueenMother and the Duke of Anjou afterwards Henry III
he arranges the massacre of the Huguenots Of the events of the fatal
night we get a number of glimpses including the murder of a
Protestant Scroune by Mountsorrell Chapmans Montsurry who is
represented as one of the Guises most fanatical adherents Charles soon
afterwards dies and is succeeded by his brother Henry but his mind
runs on his minions and Catherine and the Guise wield all real power
But there is one sphere which Guise cannot controlhis wifes heart
which is given to Mugeroun one of the minions of the King Another of
the minions Joyeux is sent against Henry of Navarre and is defeated
and slain but Henry learning that Guise has raised an army against his
sovereign to plant the Pope and Popelings in the realm joins forces
with the King against the rebel who is treacherously murdered and dies
crying Vive la messe perish Huguenots His brother the Cardinal
meets a similar fate but the house of Lorraine is speedily revenged by
a friar who stabs King Henry He dies vowing vengeance upon Rome and
sending messages to Queen Elizabeth whom God hath blessd for hating
papistry
It is easy to see how a play on these lines would have appealed to an
Elizabethan audience while Marlowe whether his religious sympathies
were engaged or not realized the dramatic possibilities of the figure
of the Guise one of the lawlessly aspiring brotherhood that had so
irresistible a fascination for his genius But it is much more difficult
to understand why soon after the accession of James I Chapman should
have gone back to the same period of French history and reintroduced a
number of the same prominent figures Henry III Guise his Duchess and
Mountsorrell not in their relation to great political and religious
outbreaks but grouped round a figure who can scarcely have been very
familiar to the English theatregoing publicLouis de Clermont Bussy
dAmboisexii1
This personage was born in 1549 and was the eldest son of Jacques de
Clermont dAmboise seigneur de Bussy et de SaxeFontaine by his first
wife Catherine de Beauvais He followed the career of arms and in 1568
we hear of him as a commandant of a company He was in Paris during the
massacre of St Bartholomew and took advantage of it to settle a
private feud He had had a prolonged lawsuit with his cousin Antoine de
Clermont a prominent Huguenot and follower of the King of Navarre
While his rival was fleeing for safety he had the misfortune to fall
into the hands of Bussy who dispatched him then and there He
afterwards distinguished himself in various operations against the
Huguenots and by his bravery and accomplishments won the favour of the
Duke of Anjou who after the accession of Henry III in 1575 was heir
to the throne The Duke in this year appointed him his couronell and
henceforward he passed into his service In 1576 as a reward for
negotiating la paix de Monsieur with the Huguenots the Duke
received the territories of Anjou Touraine and Berry and at once
appointed Bussy governor of Anjou In November the new governor arrived
at Angers the capital of the Duchy and was welcomed by the citizens
but the disorders and exactions of his troops soon aroused the anger of
the populace and the King had to interfere in their behalf though for
a time Bussy set his injunctions at defiance At last he retired from
the city and rejoined the Duke in close intercourse with whom he
remained during the following years accompanying him finally on his
unsuccessful expedition to the Low Countries in the summer of 1578 On
Anjous return to court in January 1579 Bussy who seems to have
alienated his patron by his presumptuous behaviour did not go with him
but took up his residence again in the territory of Anjou He was less
occupied however with his official duties than with his criminal
passion for FranAoise de Maridort wife of the Comte de Monsoreau who
had been appointed grandveneur to the Duke The favorite mansion of
the Comte was at La CoutanciA re and it was here that Bussy ardently
pursued his intrigue with the Countess But a jocular letter on the
subject which he sent to the Duke of Anjou was shown according to the
historian De Thou by the Duke to the King who in his turn passed it
on to Montsoreau The latter thereupon forced his wife to make a
treacherous assignation with Bussy at the chAteau on the night of the
18th of August and on his appearance with his companion in pleasure
Claude Colasseau they were both assassinated by the retainers of the
infuriated husband
The tragic close of Bussys life has given his career an interest
disproportionate to his historical importance But the drama of La
CoutanciA re was only the final episode in a career crowded with romantic
incidents The annalists and memoirwriters of the period prove that
Bussys exploits as a duellist and a gallant had impressed vividly the
imagination of his contemporaries Margaret of Valois the wife of Henry
IV BrantA me who was a relative and friend of DAmbois and LEstoile
the chronicler and journalist are amongst those who have left us their
impressions of this beau sabreur Chapman must have had access to
memorials akin to theirs as a foundation for his drama and though for
chronological reasons they cannot have been utilized by him they
illustrate the materials which he employed
The first two Acts of the play are chiefly occupied with Bussys
arrival at court his entry into the service of Monsieur his quarrel
with Guise and the duel between himself and Barrisor with two
supporters on either side BrantA me in his Discours sur les Duels
relates from personal knowledge an incident between Guise and Bussy
which took place shortly after the accession of Henry III The Duke took
occasion of a royal hunting party to draw Bussy alone into the forest
and to demand certain explanations of him DAmbois gave these in a
satisfactory manner but had he not done so the Duke declared in spite
of their difference of rank he would have engaged in single combat with
him The explanations demanded may well have concerned the honour of the
Duchess and we get at any rate a hint for the episode in Chapmans play
I ii 57185
For the duelling narrative II i 35137 we get considerably more than
a hint Our chief authority is again BrantA me in another work the
Discours sur les Couronnels de linfanterie de France He tells us
that he was with Bussy at a play when a dispute arose between him and
the Marquis of SaintPhal as to whether the jet embroidery on a certain
muff represented XX or YY The quarrel was appeased for the time being
but on the following day Bussy meeting SaintPhal at the house of a
lady with whom he had had relations and who was now the mistress of the
Marquis renewed the dispute An encounter took place between Bussy
supported by five or six gentlemen and SaintPhal assisted by an equal
number of Scotchmen of the Royal Guard one of whom wounded Bussys
hand Thereupon SaintPhal withdrew but his fireeating rival was
anxious at all hazards for another encounter It was only with the
greatest difficulty as BrantA me relates in entertaining fashion that
the King was able to bring about a reconciliation between them Such an
episode reported with exaggeration of details might well have
suggested the narrative in Act II of the triple encounter
BrantA me further relates a midnight attack upon Bussy about a month
later by a number of his jealous rivals when he had a narrow escape
from death Of this incident another account has been given by Margaret
of Valois in her MAmoires Margaret and her brother the Duke of
Anjou were devoted to one another and Bussy was for a time a paramour
of the Queen of Navarre Though she denies the liaison she says of him
that there was not en ce siA clelA  de son sexe et de sa qualitA rien
de semblable en valeur reputation grace et esprit Margaret
LEstoile and BrantA me all relate similar incidents during Bussys
sojourn at court in the year 1578 and the lastnamed adds
Si je voulois raconter toutes les querelles quil a eues
jaurois beaucoup affaire hAlas il en a trop eu et toutes
les a desmeslAes A  son trA sgrand honneur et heur Il en
vouloit souvant par trop A  plusieurs sans aucun respect je
luy ay dict cent fois mais il se fioit tant en sa valeur quil
mesprisoit tous les conseils de ses amis    Dieu ayt son Ame
Mais il mourut quand il trespassa un preux trAs vaillant et
gAnAreux
It is plain therefore that Chapman in his picture of Bussys quarrels
and encountersatarms was deviating little except in details of names
and dates from the actual facts of history Bussys career was so
romantic that it was impossible for even the most inventive dramatist to
embellish it This was especially true of its closing episode which
occupies the later acts of Chapmans dramathe intrigue with the
Countess of Montsoreau and the tragic fate which it involved It is
somewhat singular that the earliest narratives of the event which have
come down to us were published subsequently to the play The statement
accepted for a long time that De Thous HistoriA sui Temporis was the
basis of Chapmans tragedy has been completely disproved The passage
in which he narrates the story of Bussys death does not occur in the
earlier editions of his work and first found its way into the issue
published at Geneva in 1620 A similar narrative appeared in the
following year in LEstoiles Journal which first saw the light in
1621 ten years after its authors death But under a thin disguise
there had already appeared a detailed history of Bussys last amour
and his fall though this too was later than Chapmans drama A
novelist FranAois de Rosset had published a volume of tales entitled
Les Histoires Tragiques de Nostre Temps The earliest known edition is
one of 1615 though it was preceded probably not long by an earlier
edition full of fautes insupportables for which Rosset apologizes
He is careful to state in his preface that he is relating des
histoires autant veritables que tristes et funestes Les noms de la
pluspart des personnages sont seulement desguisez en ce Theatre A  fin
de naffliger pas tant les familles de ceux qui en ont donnA le sujet
The fate of Bussy forms the subject of the seventeenth history
entitled De la mort pitoyable du valeureux Lysis Lysis was the name
under which Margaret of Valois celebrated the memory of her former lover
in a poem entitled Lesprit de Lysis disant adieu A  sa Flore But
apart from this proof of identification the details given by Rosset are
so full that there can be no uncertainty in the matter Indeed in some
of his statements as in his account of the first meeting between the
lovers Rosset probably supplies facts unrecorded by the historians of
the period
From a comparison of these more or less contemporary records it is
evident that whatever actual source Chapman may have used he has given
in many respects a faithful portrait of the historical Bussy DAmbois
It happened that at the time of Bussys death the Duke of Anjou his
patron was in London laying ineffective siege to the hand of
Elizabeth This coincidence may have given wider currency in England to
Bussys tragic story than would otherwise have been the case But a
quarter of a century later this adventitious interest would have
evaporated and the success of Chapmans play would be due less to its
theme than to its qualities of style and construction To these we must
therefore now turn
With Chapmans enthusiasm for classical literature it was natural that
he should be influenced by classical models even when handling a
thoroughly modern subject His Bussy is in certain aspects the miles
gloriosus of Latin drama while in the tragic crisis of his fate he
demonstrably borrows as is shown in this edition for the first time
the accents of the Senecan Hercules on Mount Oeta cf notes on v iv
100 and 109 Hence the technique of the work is largely of the
semiSenecan type with which Kyd and his school had familiarized the
English stage Thus Bussys opening monologue serves in some sort as a
Prologue the narrative by the Nuntius in Act II i 35137 is in the
most approved classical manner an Umbra or Ghost makes its regulation
entrance in the last Act and though the accumulated horrors of the
closing scenes violate every canon of classical art they had become
traditional in the semiSenecan type of play and were doubtless highly
acceptable to the audiences of the period But while the Senecan and
semiSenecan methods had their dangers their effect on English
dramatists was in so far salutary that they necessitated care in
plotconstruction And it is doubtful whether Chapman has hitherto
received due credit for the ingenuity and skill with which he has woven
into the texture of his drama a number of varied threads Bussys life
was as has been shown crowded with incidents and the final
catastrophe at La CoutanciA re had no direct relation with the duels and
intrigues of his younger days at Court Chapman however has connected
the earlier and the later episodes with much ingenuity Departing from
historical truth he represents Bussy as a poor adventurer at Court
whose fortunes are entirely made by the patronage of Monsieur His
sudden elevation turns his head and he insults the Duke of Guise by
courting his wife before his face thus earning his enmity and exciting
at the same time the ridicule of the other courtiers Hence springs the
encounter with Barrisor and his companions and this is made to serve as
an introduction to the amour between Bussy and Tamyra as Chapman
chooses to call the Countess of Montsurry For Barrisor we are told
II ii 202 ff had long wooed the Countess and the report was
spread that the main quarrel between him and Bussy grew about her
love Barrisor thinking that DAmboiss courtship of the Duchess of
Guise was really directed towards his elected mistress On the advice
of a Friar named Comolet to whom Chapman strangely enough assigns the
repulsive rA le of gobetween Bussy wins his way at night into
Tamyras chamber on the plea that he has come to reassure her that she
is in no way guilty of Barrisors blood Thus the main theme of the play
is linked with the opening incidents and the action from first to last
is laid in Paris whither the closing scenes of Bussys career are
shifted By another ingenious departure from historical truth the Duke
of Anjou to whom Bussy owes his rise is represented as the main agent
in his fall He is angered at the favour shown by the King to the
follower whom he had raised to serve his own ends and he conspires with
Guise for his overthrow He is the more eagerly bent upon this when he
discovers through Tamyras waitingwoman that the Countess whose
favours he has vainly sought to win has granted them to Bussy It is he
who by means of a paper convinces Montsurry of his wifes guilt and
it is he together with Guise who suggests to the Count the stratagem
by which Tamyra is forced to decoy her paramour to his doom All this
is deftly contrived and does credit to Chapmans dramatic craftsmanship
It is true that the last two Acts are spun out with supernatural
episodes of a singularly unconvincing type The Friars invocation of
Behemoth who proves a most unserviceable spirit and the vain attempts
of this scoundrelly ecclesiastics ghost to shield DAmbois from his
fate strike us as wofully crude and mechanical excursions into the
occult But they doubtless served their turn with audiences who had an
insatiable craving for such manifestations and were not particular as
to the precise form they took
In point of characterdrawing the play presents a more complex problem
Bussy is a typically Renaissance hero and appealed to the sympathies of
an age which set store above all things on exuberant vitality and
prowess and was readier than our own to allow them full rein The King
seems to be giving voice to Chapmans conception of Bussys character
when he describes him in III ii 90 ff as
A man so good that only would uphold
Man in his native noblesse from whose fall
All our dissentions arise c
And in certain aspects Bussy does not come far short of the ideal thus
pictured His bravery versatility frankness and readiness of speech
are all vividly portrayed while his mettlesome temper and his arrogance
are alike essential to his rA le and are true to the record of the
historical DAmbois But there is a coarseness of fibre in Chapmans
creation an occasional foulmouthed ribaldry of utterance which robs
him of sympathetic charm He has in him more of the swashbuckler and the
bully than of the courtier and the cavalier Beaumont and Fletcher one
cannot help feeling would have invested him with more refinement and
grace and would have given a tenderer note to the lovescenes between
him and Tamyra Bussy takes the Countesss affections so completely by
storm and he ignores so entirely the rights of her husband that it is
difficult to accord him the measure of sympathy in his fall which the
fate of a tragic hero should evoke
Tamyra appeals more to us because we see in her more of the conflict
between passion and moral obligation which is the essence of drama Her
scornful rejection of the advances of Monsieur II ii though her
husband palliates his conduct as that of a bachelor and a courtier I
and a prince proves that she is no light o love and that her
surrender to Bussy is the result of a sudden and overmastering passion
Even in the moment of keenest expectation she is torn between
conflicting emotions II ii 169182 and after their first interview
Bussy takes her to task because her
Conscience is too nice
And bites too hotly of the Puritane spice
But she masters her scruples sufficiently to play the thoroughgoing
dissembler when she meets her husband and she keeps up the pretence
when she declares to Bussy before the Court III ii 138 Yare one I
know not and speaks of him vaguely in a later scene as the man So
too when Montsurry first tells her of the suspicions which Monsieur
has excited in him she protests with artfully calculated indignation
against the charge of wrongdoing with this serpent But the brutal
and deliberate violence of her husband when he knows the truth and the
perfidious meanness with which he makes her the reluctant instrument of
her lovers ruin win back for her much of our alienated sympathy Yet
at the close her position is curiously equivocal It is at her prayer
that Bussy has spared Montsurry when he hath him down in the final
struggle but when her lover is mortally wounded by a pistol shot she
implores his pardon for her share in bringing him to his doom And when
the Friars ghost seeks to reconcile husband and wife the former is
justified in crying ironically V iv 16364
See how she merits this still kneeling by
And mourning his fall more than her own fault
Montsurrys portraiture indeed suffers from the same lack of
consistency as his wifes In his earlier relations with her he strikes
a tenderer note than is heard elsewhere in the play and his first
outburst of fury when his suspicions are aroused springs like
Othellos from the depth of his love and trust IV i 16970
My whole heart is wounded
When any least thought in you is but touchd
But there is nothing of Othellos noble agony of soul nor of his sense
that he is carrying out a solemn judicial act on the woman he still
loves in Montsurrys longdrawn torture of his wife Indeed a
comparison of the episodes brings into relief the restraint and purity
of Shakespeares art when handling the most terrible of tragic themes
Yet the Moor himself might have uttered Montsurrys cry V i 18385
Here here was she
