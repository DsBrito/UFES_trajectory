Reminiscences of Queensland 18621899
CHAPTER I
As it is in the blood of most Englishmen from the West Country to seek
adventure abroad it is little wonder that the visit of an uncle from
Australia strengthened a desire I felt to seek my fortune in that
country This uncleH C Corfieldwas the owner of some pastoral
country in the Burnett district and described in glowing terms life in
the Australian bush I might say here this was not all it had been
painted but that by the way
And so it happened that on a cold foggy morning in February 1862 I
found myself with an old schoolmateGeorge Custardon board of as it
was then customary to advertise the good ship City of Brisbane
1100 tons burthen Neville Master which lay in Plymouth Sound
waiting her final complement of passengers for Queensland
Mr Henry Jordan who was representing the Colony came on board to
address the passengers who he said were going to a land of promise
where in the evening of his life a manas the reward of his
labourwould sit in the shade of his own fig tree and enjoy the rest he
had earned
Soon the capstan was manned and the anchor lifted to the old chantey
For tinkers and tailors and lawyers and all
Way Aye Blow the men down
They ship for real sailors aboard the Black Ball
Give me some time to blow the men down
Blow boys blow to Californeoo
Theres plenty of gold so weve been told
On the banks of Sacremento
This we found was our goodbye to England and towed out by a tug we
commenced our long voyage to Australia When well clear of the land the
tug dropped us and with a favourable breeze we made quick passage to
the entrance of the channel
By this time most of the passengers were suffering the usual
disabilities felt by landsmen for the first few days at sea I soon
gained my sea legs and was able to take a view of my surroundings
Here we were365 human beings who would be cooped up for weeks in a
sailing ship and with as many different characters sympathies and
antipathies one wondered if it could be possible to live long with
harmony and unselfishness in such daily crowded contact I suppose we
were representative of the many who whether in the poop or steerage of
similar ships were looking hopefully towards the far off
notlongnamed southern colony which was becoming known to the people
of Great Britain
I was just nineteen and all things looked bright and cheerful but I
was impatient for the time when on a bounding steed I would be
scouring the plains following the sheep and cattle on my uncles
property where as an employee I was to begin my adventures
After a passage of 137 days spent either in glorious runs before
favouring winds wearisome calms or battling against heavy gales we
arrived in Moreton Bay and in due course at Brisbane
The city as it was in 1862 has so often been described that it is
unnecessary for me to say anything as to its appearance All I need say
is that it did not enter my mind to anticipate its growth and
importance
Our ships surgeon was Dr Margetts who for many years afterwards
practised his profession at Warwick It is to his credit that we had no
deaths on the voyage but immediately after landing a little girl
passenger died I helped to dig her grave on the ridges somewhere out
towards Fortitude Valley My destination was Stanton Harcourt 55
miles northwest from Maryborough which my uncle held as a station He
was taking an active part in the great developments which at this time
were being carried out by the squatters I was directed by my uncles
agents George Raff and Co to engage five or six of the immigrants as
shepherds These accompanied me to Maryborough by the old steamer
Queensland On arrival at Maryborough the shepherds were taken charge
of by the local agents and I was instructed to ride on to the station
I left Maryborough alone the same afternoon but had not gone far when I
found I was bushed Riding back I struck the main road and followed it
to the public house at the Sixmile which was a favourite camping place
for carriers My newchum freshness immediately attracted the attention
of the bullockdrivers camped there who told me of the dangers I would
meet from the blacks unless I propitiated them by generous gifts of
tobacco
These stories so much impressed me that I bought a large quantity of
tobacco from the publican After that when I saw any blacks even if
off the road I would ride over and give some tobacco which surprised
and amused them considerably I arrived at the public house at a place
known as Musket Hat in time for dinner A gentleman who knew my uncle
happened to be there and whilst waiting for dinner said Come out
and I will show you a good racehorse Outside a horse was being groomed
by a man who took some pains to describe his good points I appreciated
the mans kindness and on leaving handed him a shilling to buy a drink
This he took with a smile and thanked me I felt somewhat small when my
friend told me that I had tipped the owner of the horse himself and
that he would tell the joke in such a way that it would be long before I
forgot it and this proved to be so
Towards sundown my friend left me at the turn off of the main road My
first ride through Australian bush was very lonely and I was very
timid I heard what sounded like revolver shots loud shouting and
much swearing This I learned later was the ordinary language used when
driving bullocks while what I took to be revolver shots was the
cracking of bullockwhips At the time I imagined a battle was being
fought with bushrangers but it turned out that it was merely the
station bullock teams going to Maryborough for stores and to bring up
the hands engaged by me with their belongings
I found the station in charge of a manager and that my uncle had gone
north in search of new country for the sheep Grass seed and foot rot
were playing havoc with the sheep on Stanton Harcourt Shortly after
my arrival 1000 head of cattle purchased from White of Beaudesert
reached the station In those days pounds were unknown and I now had my
first experience in drafting cattle in an open yard An old cow
evidently knowing that I was raw came at me and would have caught me
but that my hat fell off and attracted her attention She impaled the
hat instead of me My next lesson was in bullock driving I was sent
with two loads of wool to Maryborough having a black boy to drive one
team and another boy to muster the bullocks These would not allow the
black boys to go near them to yoke up so I had to do this for both
teams After capsizing my dray three times on the road and pulling down
a fence in the town I delivered the wool The blacks had a short time
before stuck up several drays and carried the loading in their canoes
across the river
On the far side there was a dense scrub through which it was difficult
to track them My boys said I would be stuck up when passing this spot
so I rode on the dray carrying a loaded revolver However I was not
molested probably due to the fact that unknown to me Lieutenant
Wheeler with his troopers were at the moment busy among the blacks
My uncle had returned before me but had not been successful in securing
country When lambing came on Custard and I were sent out without any
special instructions to lamb a flock of ewes Following the strong mob
back to the yards in the evening the lambs tried my temper I provided
myself with stones and being a fairly good shot I reduced the
percentage of lambs to some extent
One night there was a great stampede in the yard and thinking it was a
dingo among the sheep I went out with a gun Seeing an object moving in
the dark I fired both barrels and the supposed dingo fell I had shot
one of the ration sheep which had been dropped during the day Being
without any control or instructions in regard to the sheep we decided
our working hours to berise at 7 am breakfast at 730 start work
at 8 The sheep remained in the yard until the lastmentioned hour
This did not improve their condition One morning my uncle arrived
before we had turned out and expressed himself strongly upon the
laziness of new chums in general Excusing ourselves by the fact that it
was not yet seven did not calm the atmosphere My uncle was one who
insisted upon plenty of time for a long days work I very quickly
learned the value of early rising in the bush and in the interest of
the sheep when necessary to go without breakfast
I remember my first night alone in the bush I was sent to an
outstation with 300 sheep and a black boy to assist in driving them
At sundown I could see nothing of the hut I had read that fires would
keep off native dogs or dingoes I tied my horse to a tree and gathered
wood forming a ring of fires around the sheep The black boy said
something to me in his own language Thinking he asked me if he should
bring some more wood I replied with the only word I knew Yewi After
a little time I missed the boy and cooeed for him He replied as from a
distance I wondered why he had gone so far when there was plenty of
wood close by He did not return and it was not long before my horse
broke away All night was spent walking around the sheep What weird
sounds I heard and what strange shapes I saw moving When one is alone
in the bush at night even after years of experience the imagination is
apt to run riot Especially is it so at midnight and towards the small
hours of the morning At daylight the sheep commenced to move I
followed them carrying my saddle and bridle About midday one of the
station boys found me and inquired why I sent the black boy home It
then dawned on me why I had been left alone The boy had asked to be
allowed to go home and I had said Yewiyes I suppose I was only
undergoing the usual bush experience of the new chum and had a good
deal to learn but I was undoubtedly learning
CHAPTER II
Following the cotton strike in England during 1863 a large number of
Lancashire operatives emigrated to Australia As the station needed
shepherds the agents in Brisbane were instructed to engage two married
couples and three single men I was despatched with a black boy three
horses and a dray to bring them from Maryborough Their luggage filled
the dray but I managed to find room for the two women and the children
The others had to walk The first day out we reached Mr Helshams
station at South Doongal He allotted me an empty hut for the party At
dinner that evening I told him and the overseer how very frightened the
emigrants were of the blacks Is that so he said Well we will try
them tonight after the boys have had their evening corroborree A
number of blacks were camped there at the time so he sent word to his
station boys to come up When they did so he told them to surround the
hut and yell out Kill em white fella kill em white Mary We went
down to see what we thought was fun I never had to run harder than I
did to reach the station before the new chums who streamed out of the
hut in their night attire and made for the house I had the greatest
difficulty in pacifying them They refused to return to the hut and
camped on the verandah the single men remaining on watch
After their flight from the hut the pigs appropriated their rations
which confirmed their belief in a narrow escape from wholesale
slaughter I felt sorry for the joke more particularly as for the
remainder of the journey they would not leave the dray or go for water
unless the black boy or I went with them As shepherds these men were
not a success They were invariably losing sheep adding to my
responsibility as overseer
In September of that year I had my first experience of
shearinggetting through 20 the first day It was backaching and
wristbreaking work and I longed for the day when I went out with the
ration packhorse
In those days the sheep were handwashed in a water hole in which we
worked up to our middle all day The blacks had to be watched very
closely as if opportunity offered they would catch a sheeps hind leg
with their toes and drown the animal expecting they would get the
meat I detected them in the act so I burnt the carcase This put an
end to the practice Mustering and branding the cattle followed the
shearing and these were much livelier occupations We had a heavy wet
season in that year and I had plenty of opportunities to gain
experience in flooded creeks About April 1863 Edward Palmer years
afterwards MLA for Carpentaria who was in charge of his uncles
station Eureka four miles from Stanton Harcourt started with the
sheep depasturing there for the Gulf country He eventually settled at
Canobie on the Williams River a tributary of the Cloncurry
In September one of the new shepherds absconded leaving his sheep in
the yard at an outstation I was instructed by my uncle to take out a
summons and applied to Mr W H Gaden a neighbouring squatter for
it The summons was sent to Maryborough for service In due time I had
to appear as prosecutor The man had engaged a solicitor who when the
case was called on applied for a discharge as the summons did not
state it was sworn to but only signed W H Gaden JP The man was
discharged on these grounds I was not sorry He was useless as a
shepherd but through him I had obtained an enjoyable ride to
Maryborough with all expenses paid
My uncle in the meantime had again started out to seek new country for
the sheep and engaged Mr Walter Carruthers of Carruthers and Wood
Rocky Springs station Auburn River to take charge of the mob of
12000 leaving instructions that they were to start before the end of
1864
Great preparations were required to equip the party We were taking 30
saddle horses two bullock teams and one horse team In addition to the
stores we had to provide all sorts of tools etc to build and form a
new station
I preferred to drive one of the bullock teams My duties on arrival at
camp were to erect a tent and two iron stretchers for Carruthers and
myself take my watch every night from three to daylight and then to
muster the bullocks In the case of dry stages I also had to take water
to the men
When passing through Gayndah I purchased tobacco from John Connolly who
died lately at the very great age of 102 years and for which I had to
pay 1 per pound
When we came to the Dawson River near Mrs McNabbs station it was in
flood We felled a big tree across the stream and with boughs and other
timber improvised a bridge For three days we were working in our
shirts only getting the sheep andwhen the water fellthe teams
across Mosquitoes sandflies and a hot sun made us nearly raw Along
this road Carruthers had his favorite horse Tenby stolen He had hung
the animal up to the verandah post of a wayside public house to see the
sheep and teams pass After they had gone by and while Carruthers was
having a drink a man jumped on the horse and galloped away Carruthers
walked on to the sheep got a fresh horse and with our black boy
followed the thief until they came to the spot where in a piece of
scrub he had pulled the mane and tail of the horse to alter its
appearance Darkness coming on they had to abandon further pursuit The
horse was a very fine chestnut A new saddle and bridle a pouch
containing cheque book and revolver were taken with him so the robber
had a good haul There were no telegraph stations out back in those
days
When passing Apis Creek near the Mackenzie River I met a man named
Christie whom I afterwards learnt was Gardiner the exbushranger We
passed through Taroom Springsure on to Peak Downs station where we
essayed a short cut on to the Cotherstone road but when we had got
halfway the owner made us turn back I had a very rough time driving
the leading dray through the loose black soil and was glad to get back
on the road which was well beaten by the teams carrying copper from
Clermont to Broadsound
We eventually reached Lords Table Mountain where we had permission to
remain whilst I took the drays into Clermont to be repaired and to
obtain an additional supply of rations Whilst staying at Winters
Hotel I met Griffin the wardenafterwards hanged for shooting the
troopers guarding the gold escort of which he was in charge
I also met Fitzmaurice destined in after years to become my partner in
the far west He had brought in drays from Surbiton station to be
repaired
Carruthers then rented some country from Rolfe on Mistake Creek on
which to shear the sheep I shore 800 My salary was now 80 per year
for which I acted as overseer bookkeeper and giving a hand as general
utility at all kinds of work After shearing the sheep were taken down
to Chambers Camp on the same creek whilst I took the wool to Port
Mackay When crossing the Expedition Range before reaching Clermont on
my way from Mistake Creek I rode over to a small diggings to purchase
meat The only butcher was a man named Jackson whose wife served me
She was a fine comely woman whom I afterwards met on the Lower Palmer
where her husband was keeping a store He was burnt to death on
Limestone Creek on that river Eventually she married Thos Lynett a
packer from Cooktown to Edwards Town as Maytown was popularly known
and who with Fitzmaurice and myself was in later years one of the
founders of Winton on the Western River Mrs Lynett lately died in
Winton at the ripe age of 84 her husband Tom Lynett having
predeceased her some years Like most of the women who pioneered she
had a grand heart and I learnt how the diggers appreciated her motherly
kindness
The early wet season caught me at Boundary Creek ten miles beyond Nebo
I was stuck in a bog for five weeks rain pouring the whole time I
eventually delivered the wool loaded up rations from Brodziak Bros
and started on my return journey In those days the range was in a
primitive state and coming down my mate capsized his dray While I was
assisting him I had a Colts revolver stolen off my dray presumably by
some of the road party who were cutting down the steep parts
After crossing the range the pleuro broke out amongst my bullocks and
I lost one whole team I went into Retreat station and purchased several
steers The hot weather and heavy pulling soon killed these leaving me
stranded on the Isaacs River One day a squatter from North Creek
station rode up and hearing my plight said there was a team of
bullocks running on his country for several months Who the owner was
or where they came from was unknown Acting on his hint I picked out
what I considered the best and continued my journey to the sheep
Having met my requirements I turned the bullocks loose In response to
enquiries I denied that I was the owner of them they had served my
purpose and I was content to let well alone
The blacks were very bad and continually worrying the men we had
shepherding One of these was rather daft One night the rams did not
return I got on their tracks the next day and brought them to camp but
there was no sign of the shepherd Two evenings after we were surprised
to see a couple of Myalls bringing in the lost man We gave the blacks
some tucker and they left but not before the shepherd raising his
hat said to them I thank you gentlemen most sincerely His
eccentric manner had doubtless saved his life as the coloured races
generally appear to respect a demented person
I had a very bad attack of fever and ague and managed to ride into
Clermont where I was treated by a chemist named Mackintosh who kindly
allowed me to stay at his house I shall never forget the kindness of
him and his wife in pulling me through Carruthers in the meantime had
taken the sheep back to a creek which is still known as Corfields
Creek There the lambing took place
We next moved down to Balgourlie Station still on Mistake Creek where
we had an early shearing and left the wool to be taken by carriers to
Bowen
I now had my first experience of what was called in those days
Belyando Spew Everything one ate came back again and no one seemed to
know of an antidote to what appeared to be a summer sickness The gidya
around seemed to accentuate the complaint until I became a walking
skeleton
In the meantime we received word that my uncle had purchased Clifton
Station from Marsh and Webster of Mackay
This country was situated on a billabong 12 miles from Canobie where
Edward Palmer as I have previously mentioned had settled down
The travelling away from the gidya scrubs down the Belyando River soon
dispelled all signs of the sickness
Previous to leaving Balgourlie Station we had lost a mob of horses and
on our arrival at Mount McConnell Station the two men who had been
despatched to look for them returned without success Carruthers then
sent me back with an Indian named Balooche Knight to make a search We
had a riding horse each and a pack horse to carry our blankets tucker
etc After scouring all the scrubs on Mistake Creek we arrived at
Lanark Downs Station where a traveller informed me he had seen a number
of horses at Miclere Creek 17 miles on the road to Copperfield My
optimism suggested I should ask the owner of Lanark Downs to lend me a
fresh horse He did so and I rode away one morning returning the same
evening with the whole of the 17 horses we had lost I had now to travel
over one hundred miles to where I had left the sheep which were still
continuing their journey It was a most enjoyable ride with only one
drawback The Indians blankets and mine being together I had gathered
a lively community in my head Procuring a small toothcomb at a
wayside place I commenced operations with the result that soon I had
quite a colony on a newspaper in front of me With the aid of tobacco
water I finally succeeded in driving the pests away
In following down the Belyando River I proved my expertness as a
tracker by recognising the track of a bullock crossing the road I did
not know the beast had been lost but the peculiarity of the track
caused by the hind feet touching the ground ahead of the fore feet led
me to follow the tracks through a scrub and there I found him camped
We had over 60 miles to overtake the sheep and as he could not keep up
with the horses I had to leave him
We had passed St Anns and Mt McConnells Stations where Lieutenant
Fred Murray was stationed with his black trackers Proceeding up the
Cape River we overtook the sheep at Natal Downs then owned by Wm
Kellett We left the Cape River here and followed Amelia Creek through
a lot of spinifex country
On the third camp in my early morning watch I noticed several of the
sheep jumping At daylight we found about 60 lying dead on the ground
We learnt that they had been eating the poison bush which abounds
throughout what is designated as the Desert Country
The leaf of this bush is shaped like an inverted heart and in colour is
a very bright green The flower resembles a pea blossom and when in
bloom the bush is most deadly to all stock This experience taught us to
be more careful and in one place we cut a track through five miles of
it for the sheep to pass
When we reached Torrens Creek we saw a waterhole containing the bones
of some 10000 sheep which had perished from the same cause They were a
portion of 20000 which we were informed were in charge of a Mr
Halloran who had preceded us for the Flinders and owned by a Mr
Alexander
We afterwards passed a green flat quite dry but in the wet season
covered with water called Billy Webbs Lake
I was suffering from a severe attack of sandy blight in both eyes so
had to ride a horse which was tied to the bullock dray I was
horsdecombat for over a week Not having any eyewater the only
relief I could get was cold tea leaves at night Both eyes were so
swollen that I was completely blind Fortunately we met the McKinlay
expedition returning from an unsuccessful search after Leichhardt The
doctor gave me a bottle of his eyewater which he informed me contained
some nitrate of silver this he instructed me how to use and I soon
regained my eyesight but the eyes continued very weak
Shortly afterwards we met some travellers and enquired how far it was
to the jumpupmeaning the descent from the plateau to the level
country at the head of the Flinders They replied in two miles you
will be amongst the rolypoly
These we found were not stones as we thought but dry stumps of a weed
which grows on the open downs in the shape of a ball The strong
tradewinds blow the plant away from its roots and send it careering
over the downs jumping for yards and high in the air frightening
ones horse when it gets between his hind legs giving him the
impression that he had slept and dreamt he was young again
We passed Hughenden Station which had just been taken over by Mr
Robert Gray from Mr Ernest Henry and camped the sheep where the town
of Hughenden now stands
We then had a long stage of fifteen miles to the bend of the river
without water The remainder of our trip down the river was uneventful
We passed Telemon Stewarts Marathon then owned by Carson Richmond
Downs Bundock and Hayes Lara Donkin Brothers and Canobie Edward
Palmer
At Clifton our destination there was a fine waterhole two and ahalf
miles long trees on the banks were crowded with cockatoos corellas
with galahs in flocks on the plains
Work soon commenced in earnest and progress made in building a small
house sheep yards and the necessary improvements for a sheep station
The country consisted of plains with patches of scrub between in which
there was abundance of saltbush all carrying good feed for the sheep
CHAPTER III
Mr Carruthers agreement to take charge of the sheep until they arrived
at their destination having expired my uncle wrote me to take over the
station and advised that if I remained in charge he would increase my
salary to 200 per year As Carruthers was anxious to return to his
station I accepted the former but replied that unless the pay for
managing was increased to 300 per year to send someone at once to take
my place
In the meantime the blacks had come into Canobie at night and attacked
three men who were camped on the river within sight of the station
They killed two and the third was left for dead He was found to be
alive and afterwards recovered from the severe battering he received
Palmer sent word asking me to send all the men I could spare to come
over to assist in hunting the murderers I did so Carruthers taking
charge of the armed party
A few days previous to this occurrence I had visited an outstation to
count the sheep taking a man with me to help in repairing the yard
On returning after dark we passed a billabong from which a very strong
stench as if from decomposed vegetable matter arose The following
morning we both felt unwell and vomited a good deal The man with me
was much older than I and succumbed to the sickness in nine days
After the party had left for Canobie I was completely prostrated and
had no medicine on hand except Epsom salts During the night we the
cook a newchum Cockney and myself heard voices down at the
waterhole which we took as from a party of travelling Chinamen In
the morning we found that some of the blacks who were implicated in the
murder had doubled back and had taken away every article of iron they
could find our camp oven included and my clothes which had just been
washed This so preyed on my mind that when the party returned they
found me delirious
Mr Carruthers seeing the helpless state I was in and the condition of
affairs generally engaged Mr Reg Uhr to take charge on my behalf
whilst he took me down to Burketown distant 155 miles in a cart with
two horses The road was almost deserted and the blacks were very bad
Carruthers would boil his billy at waterholes in the afternoon and go
out to the centre of the plains to camp with no bells on the horses As
for myself I was sick and weak Not being able to eat damper or meat I
was almost starved lost all vitality and cared little whether I
survived the trip or not We had to cross the Plains of Promise These
consisted of an uninterrupted run of about 30 miles of devildevil
country It was a succession of small gutters and mounds which to a
sick man in a cart without springs was intolerable We arrived at
Burketown about November 1866 and the public house was the only place
in which I could get accommodation There I suffered all the nightly
noises incidental to a bush shanty
Burketown at this time was an almost new settlement with a population
of about 50 whites but the number of graves of those who died within
its short life from fever was more than twice as many and increasing
daily
The Burketown fever was more virulent than any other I had hitherto or
since come in contact with and was supposed to be a kind of yellow jack
fever introduced by some vessel from Eastern countries
The danger of a second introduction of the same or perhaps worse
epidemic does not appear in these days to be realised in Australia
There was no doctor in the town but a chemist named Peacock was
practising as one Just as I arrived Captain Cadell in the old
Eagle arrived to send despatches of his explorations of the rivers on
the west coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria where the party had seen
numerous herds of buffaloes
Mr Carruthers heard that there was a doctor with the expedition and on
his interviewing him the latter said he would see me provided I paid
the fee to the resident doctor This professional etiquette was agreed
to The doctor took great pains in diagnosing my case which he called
something between a gastric and jungle fever and prescribed five grains
of calomel every night This I found later to have loosened my teeth
and 15 grains of quinine daily seriously affected my hearing The local
chemist was then sent for He felt my pulse looked at my tongue and
prescribed a box of Holloways pills I paid him his fee of one guinea
but almost needless to say which advice I followed
I remained in Burketown about a fortnight slowly recovering Before
leaving I purchased a microscope which was for sale and presented it to
the doctor of the expedition with sincere thanks for saving my life
During the time I was in Burketown Mr Sharkey Lands Commissioner
came over from Sweers Island and offered to submit my name for the
Commission of Peace and said Mr Landsborough the Police Magistrate
would swear me in I declined the honour
When returning to Clifton Station we spent a week at Floraville Station
on the Leichhardt River Here I purchased stores for the station from
Mr Borthwick who was managing for Mr J G Macdonald At this station
there was a waterhole 25 miles long and in bathing one would see
crocodiles basking on the rocks and bank but they appeared to be
harmless At the lower end of this hole there was a perpendicular drop
of over 40 feet with a very deep hole at the foot infested by sharks
and alligators The tides came to this point
We called at Donors Hill Station where I first made the acquaintance
of the Brodie brothers one of whom afterwards managed Nive Downs for a
number of years The otherhis twin brotherdied in New South Wales
not long since after a long and successful business career At this
place I visited a cave containing many skulls of blacks who had been
dispersed by the whites after committing a series of depredations in
the district I was told the cave was so dark that matches were lighted
to allow of aim being taken at the blacks during the dispersal
In later years I have often thought what fortunes might have been won
or lost or the settlement of Western Queensland been advanced by years
had the early seekers for pastoral country but known what was west of
