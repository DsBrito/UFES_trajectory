estimate of the honor and integrity of public men and his essential
contempt for the masses may be contrasted with his high appreciation of
the debauching power of money that the enslavement by himself and his
associates of the naturally great State of California and her indignant
people may be once more proclaimed with bitter protest and earnest
appeal to all the citizens of our sister States throughout our vast
commonwealth and to the end that no such palpable embodiment of
political infamy may continue to stalk without rebuke through all
the open ways and sacred recesses of popular power crystallized at
WashingtonI propose to revive the recollection ofand to briefly
comment onthe whilom notorious HuntingtonColton Letters which became
public property as part of the records of the Superior Court of Sonoma
County in this State
HuntingtonColton Letters
Of an apparent nearly 600 only about 200 are in evidence It is to be
regretted that more did not come to light If the public could only
be privileged to read what he wrote to Leland Stanford and to Charles
Crocker and to Mark Hopkinsas well as to David D Coltonthere
there would be much to reflect upon But the public never will see such
letters The nature of them required their immediate destruction
As Huntington explains
I am often asked by my associates in California about my views in
matters that I have written to the others of and allow me to say that
all letters that I number consecutively I have supposed would be read
by all and then go into the basket together No 561 N Y April
7th 1875
That was the safest way It is not wise to allow great numbers of
thinking people to read that they are victims of chicanery corruption
in high places bribery hire and salary and oppression through
conspiracy There might be something more than a spice of danger in much
carelessness
Tone of the Letters
The letters under consideration written during the four years from
October 1874 to October 1878 tell a plain enough tale of their own
They abound with cool and easy allusions to various men and things to
convincing public servants to fixing committees in Congress
to persuading the most exalted officials purchasing National
legislators as well as Territorial Governors to deceiving local
communities and the United States generally with well considered
cunning to working noisily with blatant instruments and quietly through
masked agents to creating public opinion by means of false showings
to electing or defeating candidates for office to smiting enemies and
rewarding friends
Viewed as a contribution to the literature of fatal political infection
the letters are unique They embody an epitome of just such work as
their writer is prepared to now continue if the temper of the American
people will permit him to do so
The plane upon which his exertions will possibly be made may be justly
imagined from the intimate knowledge and implied approval of bribery on
a collossal scale which he mentions frankly and carelessly thus
I returned from Washington last night The subcommittee of the R
R Committee of the House have agreed to report Scott T and P Bills
through to San Diego and I am disposed to think the full committee
will report it to the House It can be hoped but I doubt if it would
be worth the cost as I do not think it can pass the House Scott no
doubt will promise all thesay 40000000 that the Act would give
him No 428 N Y Feb 23 1878
And thus
The T and P folks are working hard on their bill    They offered
one M C one thousand dollars cash down five thousand when the Bill
passed and ten thousand of the bonds when they got them if he would
vote for the Bill No 455 N Y May 3 1878
The thought naturally occurs here If such matterofcourse mention
of appalling debauch cry of political honor and morality reflects the
character of a conscience and foreshadows the scope of a purposeif
such were his estimate of Congress and such his belief thenhow much
are the Central Pacific magnates disposed to promise now to soon evade
and eventually escape payment of say 67000000 now nearly due to the
Government
The People Can Never Have an Open Highway
In 1874 Thomas A Scott of Pennsylvania proposed to build the Texas
and Pacific Railway and to secure subsidies for that purpose from the
Southern States as well as from Congress
With the question of subsidies in the abstract this writing has
nothing to do
If he succeeded the Southern Pacific would lose its early clutch on
the throat of our commerce an hundred thousand voters would escape from
political bondageits paralyzing grip would be weakened if not broken
There was deadly issue at once
Scott wrote to Huntington Dec 9 1874
We expect to build our road to San Diego as already pledged to the
public to do so No 416 N Y Dec 10 1874
Later Huntington wrote to Colton
Scott is doing all he can to push his Texas Pacific Road and his
strength all lies in one thing The Southern Pacific of California is
controlled by the Central Pacific and Union Pacific and will be used
only to help those great monopolies and if we are beat by Scott it
will be because our friends have persisted in helping him to convince
the public the above is true and the people can never have an open
highway so long as the Central Pacific controls all the roads that reach
out to the Pacific No 267 N Y April 3 1877
Behind the Scenes
These Colton letters emphasize Huntingtons opinions and expose his
methods during the struggle Not completely of course One must read
between the lines occasionally Something is left to surmiseto the
reflection of Hamlets Uncle that
In the corrupted currents of this world offenses gilded hand may shove
by Justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law
When he speaks of Mr Justice Field not sitting in a certain suit No
475 NY Sept 30th 1878 and just how he got the Secretary of War
out of all ugly idea in about twenty minutes saw three other Cabinet
members shortly after and caused a President to abandon being cross
and to laugh heartily No 361 N Y Oct 10th 1877 is not
precisely clear nor are details given as to how the Railroad Committee
was sure to be convinced No 59 N Y Nov 30 1879 or exactly
what he did before writing I stayed in Washington two days to fix up
R R Committee in Senate     The Committee is just as we want it
No 261 N Y March 7th 1877
And it should be remembered too that the writer prided himself in
confessing to deliberate wariness in bribery and caution in
corrupting occupying in high ground and preparing in advance to defy
investigators As witness
I returned from Washington this morning shall go back next Monday
night    Scott is working mostly among the commercial men He
switched Senator Spencer of Alabama and Walker of Virginia this week
but you know they can be switched back with the proper arrangements when
they are wanted but Scott is asking for so much that he can promise
largely to pay when he wins and you know I keep on high ground No
110 NY Jan 29th 1876
And again
When I see you I shall have much to tell you of Washington matters that
I have not time to write but I keep on high ground so that we cannot be
hurt by any investigation No 138 NY March 23d 1876
No just inference can be drawn from such confidential utterances that
the high ground of safety was fertile soil bearing the flowers and
fruits of political purity rather than a chosen rock of refuge from
continuous danger and the allusion to possible investigation involves
the confession that it was deserved and the dread that it might occur
Use of Influence and Power of Money
But there is no obscurity of meaning nor is there much room for
doubt that there is the expression of mature judgment based upon wide
experience and ample practice in the following
I think this coming session of Congress will be composed of the
hungriest set of men that ever got together No 389 NY Nov 30th
1874
I sent a man to Richmond Va on Saturday and one to Albany today
to get resolutions passed by the legislatures against subsidies I think
it will control two members of the R R Committee No 117 N Y
Feb 14th 1876
I left Washington on Friday the 11th I think our matters are safe
there for the Session No 218 N Y Aug 4th 1876
I think our land matters in Washington have been fixed No 366 N
Y Oct 29th 1877
I think the R R Committee is right as made up for the 45th
Congress but the Com on Territories I do not like A different one
was promised me No 373 N Y Oct 30th 1877
I do not think we can get any legislation this session for extension
of land grants unless we pay more for it than it is worth No 378 N
Y Nov 9th 1877
If we are not hurt this session it will be because we pay much money to
prevent it No 381 N Y Nov 15th 1877
This Congress is nothing but an agrarian camp No 449 N Y April
19th 1878
I have done all I can to prevent certain bills from being reached and
do not think any bills can be that will hurt us No 468 N Y June
15th 1878
I have received several letters and telegrams from Washington today
all calling me there as Scott will certainly pass his Texas Pacific
bill if I do not come over and I shall go over tonight    It cost
money to fix things so that I would know his bill would not pass I
believe that with 200000 I can pass our bill No 107 N Y Jan
17 1876
A Low Estimate of Congressional Brains and Public Interest
The alarm evidently felt and certainly shown that the Central Pacific
and Southern Pacific were apt to be commonly considered and treated as
being one concern and not as distinct and separate thingsincestuous
and eager lovers instead of alien rivals and natural foesconspirators
rather than competitorswould be simply amusing were it less offensive
and more in accordant vibration with the pulsations of common sense
amongst a people not wholly fools That it was thought possible to
foster the idea and expand it into a belief that Stanford Huntington
the Crockers and HopkinsJanus facedlooking northerly along monopoly
lines were the implacable enemies of the Crockers Stanford Hopkins
and Huntington gazing along monopoly lines southerly and that the
interests of the government and the good of the people required the
tender coddling of that nursling until it became strong enough to sit up
and take nourishment in the shape of meaty millions of dollars involves
a sarcastic comment upon measured law makers and estimated victims Yet
the improbable becomes at times the possible and the actual
Mark the plaintive wailing in the letters
On account of this legislation I think it important that the S P
should be disconnected from the Central as much as it well can be No
416 N Y Dec 10 1874
Governor S said some good things to the Chronicle interviewer but I
think it unfortunate that he should so closely connect the C P with
the S P as that is the only weapon our enemies have to fight us with
in Congress No 590 NY May 28 1875
If it was known that the C P does not control the S P I think we
could beat Scott all the time No 157 N Y April 27 1876
Stanford Tom Scott and many others have been trying for so long to
convince the country that the Central Pacific is building the S P that
I am not able now to convince Congress that it is not true No 24 N
Y Dec 25 1876
I have little or no fears of his Scott doing anything at the extra
session but if he can convince Congress that the S P is controlled by
the C P     I believe he can pass his bill to build on the direct
line between Ft Yuma and San Diego and I think I know enough of
Washington to know how he to can do it No 268 N Y March 20
1877
His Scott strength all lies in one thing The S P of Cal is
controlled by the C P and U P and will be used only to help those
great monopolies No 276 N Y April 3 1877
What you say about our stopping at Ft Yuma is well and would be
almost conclusive if the S P was not owned and controlled by the C
P but when we tell Congress we are willing to build this road the
answer is always the same Of course you are to protect the Central but
what the country wants is a competing road No 307 N Y May 17
1877
The fact is he has nearly convinced the country that the C P is
building the S P to prevent competition and I find it very hard to It
make them believe anything else No 425 N Y Feb 25 1878
Wrongs of California
So much for the United States Let us now glance at California as
mangled by the showing of the letters
And it may as well be stated just here that Leland Stanford and his
associates having first in mind and at heart the design to eventually
defraud the United States Government of many millions of dollars
bent all their energies next to the maintaining of their ownership of
California and her citizens and all their property and to keeping
under control their rights privileges hopes fears ambitions and acts
ever and ever
A competing linean open highwayacross the continent would balk
their purposes The Union Pacific was dangerous in that respect
Therefore it was to be given 1022 of the Southern Pacific stock and
become a partner instead of a rival Jay Gould was to participate in the
spoils of our bondage Concerning which the Letters say
I will say here that I think well of this as it will have our interest
in the Central greater than in the Southern Pacific which will satisfy
the Union Pacific which in my opinion is very important Of course
you will see the importance of the public not knowing anything of this
arrangement No 24 N Y December 25th 1876
Check to San Diego
How neatly the San Diegans were induced to continue to tread out the old
measures of railroad corn for their masters whose private intentions
were to lull them into silence with false hopes fasten them in
commercial vassalage and denounce as well as keep comparatively
deserted their splendid harbor is quite clearly shown
I should infer from one of the newspaper clips that you sent that our
San Diego friends were displeased about something No 14 N Y
Sept 23 1875
That was intended to be facetious
In your interesting letter of the 5th you mention San Diego matters
Now it is well to switch that people from the Texas Pacific road but
I would suggest that you keep on asking them what they will do but not
make them any definite proposition for if you do it will be sent East
at once and I am working with the South and saying to them that our
interest lays with them and that what San Francisco and Cal wants is a
direct communication with New Orleans and other Gulf ports and that our
interest lays that way and we oppose the Texas Pacific because we
think if it is built it will prevent for many years our getting such a
connection No 37 N Y October 18 1875
That was not merrily written
I would much like a report of the harbor of San Diego as I think it
is but I would not care to pay much money for it Hyde is a bright
man and if he knows how worthless the harbor of San Diego is for an
extensive deep sea commerce I would like a report from him No 335
N Y August 18 1877
In California Politics
The dominating influence of the railroad monopolists in California
politics has been California politicians They are in the vein of the
letters
The voters of California have for many years been the playthings of a
few political bandits They have been driven in the harness of their
various parties to the polls by bosses shrewdly selected and
liberally paid The results may be seen in glittering heaps of spoils
concentrated in a few hands in disheartening displays of vast wealth by
arrogant possessors who are not properly the owners of it and who are
limited alike in number as in intelligent patriotism may be felt in
unwarranted tax taxationmay be heard in the derision of insolent
laughter from lips merry with the delight of fancied security
The creation of the boss rule simplified systematic bribery
concerning which read
I received your telegram that Wm B Carr has had for his services
60000 S P bonds then asking how much more I think his services
are worth for the future    In view of the many things we have
now before Congress    it is very important that his friends in
Washington should be with us and if that could be brought about by
paying Carr say 10000 to 20000 per year I think we could afford to
do it but of course not until he had controlled his friends I would
like to have you get a written proposition from Carr in which he would
agree to control his friends for a fixed sum then send it to me No
99 N Y Jan 14 1876
So much for California
Cost of Arizona Legislature and Voters of New Mexico
If we had a franchise to build a road or two roads through Arizona we
controlling but having it in the name of another party it could be
used against Scott Cannot you have Stafford Governor of Arizona call
the Legislature together and grant such charters as we want at a cost
of say 25000 If we could get such a charter as I spoke to you of it
would be worth much money to us No 18 N Y Sept 27 1875
I think Stafford had better be in Washington at the commencement of the
regular session to get Congress to confirm the Acts of Arizona No
366 N Y Oct 29 1877
As to New Mexico
I saw Axtell Gov of New Mexico and he said he thought that if we
would send to him such a bill as we wanted to have passed into a law he
could get it passed with very little or no money when if we sent a man
there they would stick him for large amounts No 366 N Y Oct
29 1877
Corruption and Bribery
Such in part is the story of the Letters If it is not one of appalling
corruption and unhesitating bribery often repeated what else is it
Why should it cost a specific 200000 to pass any proper bill through
Congress 25000 to convene a Territorial Legislature 10000 to
20000 a year to influence justly a few Californians Influence thus
exercised is as palpable as it is direct
Nature and Value of Picnics
But ends are sometimes attained by indirection The Letters tell how
For example
I have been working for the last two month to get a party of say 25
Southern members of Congress to go out to California and over the line
of the Southern Pacific and see what we have done and our ability to do
I told Senator Gordon of Georgia if he could get up a party of the
best men of the South we would pay all their expenses which I suppose
would not be less than 10000 and I think it would be money well
expended No 208 N Y July 26th 1876
But these Southern gentlemen seem to have been somewhat hesitating as
attest
I have telegraphed today to you to get some of the prominent men of
San Francisco to telegraph to Gordon Senator from Georgia with other
Southern men to go While Gordon and some others are not afraid to go
G tells me that some of his friends do not like to go on an invitation
from the R R Co No 213 N Y Aug 7th 1876
And the fear of a thoughtful constituency appears to have resulted in
some doubts
You must have had a lively time in getting so many good names signed
and sent on in so short a time inviting our Southern brethren to come
to Cal I saw Gordon and several others just before Congress adjourned
and they said they would go but I have some doubts about it as most of
the members of Congress are looking after their reelection No 221
N Y Aug 25th 1875
By the light of the above extracts may perhaps be interpreted the
meaning of the news that has just come by telegraph that the Senate
Committee on Pacific Railroads will take a trip soon after Congress
adjourns to San Francisco by way of the Union Central and Southern
Pacific systemsin Senator Brices private car
Protest and Petition
It would be an interesting and to me a congenial task to further
analyze the Letters to show what tools the monopolists secured and how
they worked with them to set forth how rivalry was met and defeated
railroadssuch as the Santa Monicaabsorbed or paralyzed and many
things were done and undone But my intention at the outset was simply
to proclaim with irrefrageable proofs some shameful facts and to
protest against any faltering in enforcing they laws as they exist
compelling payment to the Government of great debts soon to mature
Of principal and interest there will be due from these monopolists and
political corruptionists the first payment January 16 1895 the last
January 1 1899 7704963066less some few millions now to their
credit The money can be collected and it ought to be In the meantime
the toleration of a lobby confessedly corrupt argues the existence of a
Congress at best incompetent
