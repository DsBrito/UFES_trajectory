A flock of crows rose from the trees of a nearby shelterbelt as the
flight of loaves approached The crows swooped to investigate and then
suddenly scattered screeching in panic
The helicopter of a hangoverish Sunday traveler bound for Wichita shied
very similarly from the brown fliers and did not return for a second
look
A blackhaired housewife spied them over her back fence crossed herself
and grabbed her walkietalkie from the laundry basket Seconds later
the yawning correspondent of a regional newspaper was jotting down the
lead of a humorous news story which recalling the old flyingsaucer
scares stated that now apparently bread was to be included in the mad
aerial tea party
The congregation of an openwalled country church standing up to recite
the most familiar of Christian prayers had just reached the petition
for daily sustenance when a subflight of the loaves either forced
down by a vagrant wind or lacking the natural buoyancy of the rest came
coasting silently as the sunbeams between the graceful pillars at the
altar end of the building
Meanwhile the main flight now augmented by other bread flocks from
scores and hundreds of walking mills that had started work a little
later mounted slowly and majestically into the cirrusflecked upper
air where a steady wind was blowing strongly toward the east
About one thousand miles farther on in that direction where a cluster
of stratospheretickling towers marked the location of the metropolis of
NewNew York a tender scene was being enacted in the pressurized
penthouse managerial suite of Puffy Products Megera Winterly Secretary
in Chief to the Managerial Board and referred to by her underlings as
the Blonde Icicle was dealing with the advances of Roger Racehorse
Snedden Assistant Secretary to the Board and often indistinguishable
from any passing office boy
Why dont you jump out the window Roger remembering to shut the
airlock after you the Golden Glacier said in tones not unkind When
are your highstrung thoroughbred nerves going to accept the fact that
I would never consider marriage with a business inferior You have about
as much chance as a starving Ukrainian kulak now that Moscows clapped
on the interdict
Rogers voice was calm although his eyes were feverishly bright as he
replied A lot of things are going to be different around here Meg as
soon as the Board is forced to admit that only my quick thinking made it
possible to bring the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world
Puffyloaf could do with a little of that the business girl observed
judiciously The way sales have been plummeting it wont be long
before the Government deeds our desks to the managers of Fairy Bread and
asks us to take the Big Jump But just where does your quick thinking
come into this Mr Snedden You cant be referring to the heliumthat
was Rose Thinkers brainwave
She studied him suspiciously Youve birthed another promotional
bumble Roger I can see it in your eyes I only hope its not as big a
one as when you put the Martian ambassador on 3D and he thanked you
profusely for the gross of Puffyloaves assuring you that hed never
slept on a softer mattress in all his life on two planets
Listen to me Meg Todayyes todayyoure going to see the Board
eating out of my hand
Hah I guarantee you wont have any fingers left Youre bold enough
now but when Mr Gryce and those two big machines come through that
door
Now wait a minute Meg
Hush Theyre coming now
Roger leaped three feet in the air but managed to land without a sound
and edged toward his stool Through the dilating iris of the door strode
Phineas T Gryce flanked by Rose Thinker and Tin Philosopher
The man approached the conference table in the center of the room with
measured pace and gravely expressionless face The rosetinted machine
on his left did a couple of impulsive pirouettes on the way and
twittered a greeting to Meg and Roger The other machine quietly took
the third of the high seats and lifted a claw at Meg who now occupied a
stool twice the height of Rogers
Miss Winterly pleaseour theme
The Blonde Icicles face thawed into a littlegirl smile as she chanted
bubblingly
Made up of tiny wheaten motes
And reinforced with sturdy oats
It rises through the air and floats
The bread on which all Terra dotes
Thank you Miss Winterly said Tin Philosopher Though a purely
figurative statement that bit about rising through the air always gets
mehere He rapped his midsection which gave off a high musical
clang
Ladies he inclined his photocells toward Rose Thinker and Megand
gentlemen This is a historic occasion in Old Puffys long history the
inauguration of the heliumfilled loaf So Light It Almost Floats
Away in which that inert and heavenaspiring gas replaces
oldfashioned carbon dioxide Later there will be kudos for Rose
Thinker whose bright relays geniussparked the idea and also for Roger
Snedden who took care of the details
By the by Racehorse that was a brilliant piece of work getting the
helium out of the governmenttheyve been pretty stuffy lately about
their monopoly But first I want to throw wide the casement in your
minds that opens on the Long View of Things
Rose Thinker spun twice on her chair and opened her photocells wide Tin
Philosopher coughed to limber up the diaphragm of his speaker and
continued
Ever since the first cave wife boasted to her nextden neighbor about
the superior paleness and fluffiness of her tortillas mankind has
sought lighter whiter bread Indeed thinkers wiser than myself have
equated the whole upward course of culture with this poignant quest
Yeast was a wonderful discoveryfor its primitive day Sifting the bran
and wheat germ from the flour was an even more important advance Early
bleaching and preserving chemicals played their humble parts
For a while barbarous faddistsblind to the deeply spiritual nature
of bread which is recognized by all great religionsheld back our
march toward perfection with their hairsplitting insistence on the
vitamin content of the wheat germ but their case collapsed when
tasteless colorless substitutes were triumphantly synthesized and
introduced into the loaf which for flawless purity unequaled airiness
and sheer intangible goodness was rapidly becoming mankinds supreme
gustatory experience
Illustration
I wonder what the stuff tastes like Rose Thinker said out of a clear
sky
I wonder what taste tastes like Tin Philosopher echoed dreamily
Recovering himself he continued
Then early in the twentyfirst century came the epochal researches of
Everett Whitehead Puffyloaf chemist culminating in his paper The
Structural Bubble in Cereal Masses and making possible the baking of
airtight bread twenty times stronger for its weight than steel and of
a lightness that would have been incredible even to the advanced
chemistbakers of the twentieth centurya lightness so great that
besides forming the backbone of our own promotion it has forever since
been capitalized on by our conscienceless competitors of Fairy Bread
with their enduring slogan It Makes Ghost Toast
Thats a beaut all right that ectodough blurb Rose Thinker
admitted bugging her photocells sadly Wait a sec How about
Therell be bread
Overhead
When youre dead
It is said
Phineas T Gryce wrinkled his nostrils at the pink machine as if he
smelled her insulation smoldering He said mildly A somewhat unhappy
jingle Rose referring as it does to the end of the customer as
consumer Moreover we shouldnt overplay the figurative rises through
the air angle What inspired you
She shrugged I dont knowoh yes I do I was remembering one of the
workers songs we machines used to chant during the Big Strike
Work and pray
Live on hay
Youll get pie
In the sky
When you die
Its a lie
I dont know why we chanted it she added We didnt want pieor
hay for that matter And machines dont pray except Tibetan prayer
wheels
Phineas T Gryce shook his head Labor relations are another topic we
should stay far away from However dear Rose Im glad you keep trying
to outjingle those dirty crooks at Fairy Bread He scowled turning
back his attention to Tin Philosopher I get whopping mad Old Machine
whenever I hear that other slogan of theirs the discriminatory
oneUntouched by Robot Claws Just because they employ a few filthy
androids in their factories
Tin Philosopher lifted one of his own sets of bright talons Thanks
PT But to continue my historical resume the next great advance in the
baking art was the substitution of purified carbon dioxide recovered
from coal smoke for the gas generated by yeast organisms indwelling in
the dough and later killed by the heat of baking their corpses
remaining in situ But even purified carbon dioxide is itself a rather
repugnant gas a product of metabolism whether fast or slow and forever
associated with those life processes which are obnoxious to the
fastidious
Here the machine shuddered with delicate clinkings Therefore we of
Puffyloaf are taking today what may be the ultimate step toward purity
we are aerating our loaves with the noble gas helium an element which
remains virginal in the face of all chemical temptations and whose slim
molecules are eleven times lighter than obese carbon dioxideyes noble
uncontaminable helium which if it be a kind of ash is yet the ash
only of radioactive burning accomplished or initiated entirely on the
Sun a safe 93 million miles from this planet Lets have a cheer for
the helium loaf
Without changing expression Phineas T Gryce rapped the table thrice in
solemn applause while the others bowed their heads
Thanks TP PT then said And now for the Moment of Truth Miss
Winterly how is the helium loaf selling
The business girl clapped on a pair of earphones and whispered into a
lapel mike Her gaze grew abstracted as she mentally translated flurries
of brief squawks into coherent messages Suddenly a single vertical
furrow creased her matchlessly smooth brow
It isnt Mr Gryce she gasped in horror Fairy Bread is outselling
Puffyloaves by an infinity factor So far this morning there has not
been one single delivery of Puffyloaves to any sales spot Complaints
about nondelivery are pouring in from both walking stores and sessile
shops
Mr Snedden Gryce barked What bug in the new helium process might
account for this delay
Roger was on his feet looking bewildered I cant imagine sir
unlessjust possiblytheres been some unforeseeable difficulty
involving the new metalfoil wrappers
Metalfoil wrappers Were you responsible for those
Yes sir Lastminute recalculations showed that the extra lightness of
the new loaf might be great enough to cause drift during stackage
Drafts in stores might topple sales pyramids Metalfoil wrappers by
their added weight took care of the difficulty
And you ordered them without consulting the Board
Yes sir There was hardly time and
Why you fool I noticed that order for metalfoil wrappers assumed it
was some subsecretarys mistake and canceled it last night
Roger Snedden turned pale You canceled it he quavered And told
them to go back to the lighter plastic wrappers
Of course Just what is behind all this Mr Snedden What
recalculations were you trusting when our physicists had demonstrated
months ago that the helium loaf was safely stackable in light airs and
gentle breezeswinds up to Beauforts scale 3 Why should a change
from heavier to lighter wrappers result in complete nondelivery
Roger Sneddens paleness became tinged with an interesting green He
cleared his throat and made strange gulping noises Tin Philosophers
photocells focused on him calmly Rose Thinkers with unfeigned
excitement PT Gryces frown grew blacker by the moment while Megera
Winterlys Venusmask showed an odd dawning of dismay and awe She was
getting new squawks in her earphones
Er  ah  er Roger said in winning tones Well you see the
fact is that I
Hold it Meg interrupted crisply Tripleurgent from Public
Relations Safety Division TulsaTopeka aeroexpress makes emergency
landing after being buffeted in encounter with vast flight of objects
first described as brown birds although no failures reported in
airways electronic antibird fences After grounding safely near
Emporiano fatalitiespilots windshield found thinly plastered with
soft whiteandbrown material Emblems on plastic wrappers embedded in
material identify it incontrovertibly as an undetermined number of
Puffyloaves cruising at three thousand feet
Eyes and photocells turned inquisitorially upon Roger Snedden He went
from green to Puffyloaf white and blurted All right I did it but it
was the only way out Yesterday morning due to the Ukrainian crisis
the government stopped sales and deliveries of all strategic stockpiled
materials including helium gas Puffys new program of advertising and
promotion based on the lighter loaf was already rolling There was
only one thing to do there being only one other gas comparable in
lightness to helium I diverted the necessary quantity of hydrogen gas
from the Hydrogenated Oils Section of our MagnaMargarine Division and
substituted it for the helium
You substituted  hydrogen  for the  helium Phineas T Gryce
faltered in low mechanical tones taking four steps backward
Hydrogen is twice as light as helium Tin Philosopher remarked
judiciously
And many times cheaperdid you know that Roger countered feebly
Yes I substituted hydrogen The metalfoil wrapping would have added
just enough weight to counteract the greater buoyancy of the hydrogen
loaf But
So when this mornings loaves began to arrive on the delivery
platforms of the walking mills Tin Philosopher left the remark
unfinished
Exactly Roger agreed dismally
Let me ask you Mr Snedden Gryce interjected still in low tones
if you expected people to jump to the kitchen ceiling for their
Puffybread after taking off the metal wrapper or reach for the sky if
they happened to unwrap the stuff outdoors
Mr Gryce Roger said reproachfully you have often assured me that
what people do with Puffybread after they buy it is no concern of ours
I seem to recall Rose Thinker chirped somewhat unkindly that dictum
was created to answer inquiries after Roger put the famous
sculpturesinminiature artist on 3D and he testified that he always
molded his first attempts from Puffybread one jumbo loaf squeezing down
to approximately the size of a peanut
Her photocells dimmed and brightened Oh boyhydrogen The loafs
unwrapped After a while in spite of the crustseal a little oxygen
diffuses in An explosive mixture Housewife in curlers and kimono pops
a couple slices in the toaster Boom
The three human beings in the room winced
Tin Philosopher kicked her under the table while observing So you
see Roger that the nondelivery of the hydrogen loaf carries some
consolations And I must confess that one aspect of the affair gives me
great satisfaction not as a Board Member but as a private machine You
have at last made a reality of the rises through the air part of
Puffybreads theme They cant ever take that away from you By now
half the inhabitants of the Great Plains must have observed our flying
loaves rising high
Phineas T Gryce shot a frightened look at the west windows and found
his full voice
Stop the mills he roared at Meg Winterly who nodded and whispered
urgently into her mike
A sensible suggestion Tin Philosopher said But it comes a trifle
late in the day If the mills are still walking and grinding
approximately seven billion Puffyloaves are at this moment cruising
eastward over Middle America Remember that a sixmonth supply for
deepfreeze is involved and that the current consumption of bread due
to its matchless airiness is eight and onehalf loaves per person per
day
Phineas T Gryce carefully inserted both hands into his scanty hair
feeling for a good grip He leaned menacingly toward Roger who chin
resting on the table regarded him apathetically
Hold it Meg called sharply Flock of multipleurgents coming in
News Liaison information bureaus swamped with flyingbread inquiries
Aeroexpresslines Clear our airways or face law suit U S Army Why
do loaves flame when hit by incendiary bullets U S Customs If bread
intended for export get export license or face prosecution Russian
Consulate in Chicago Advise on destination of breadlift And some
Kansas church is accusing us of a hoax inciting to blasphemy of faking
miraclesI dont know why
The business girl tore off her headphones Roger Snedden she cried
with a hysteria that would have dumfounded her underlings youve
brought the name of Puffyloaf in front of the whole world all right
Now do something about the situation
Roger nodded obediently But his pallor increased a shade the pupils of
his eyes disappeared under the upper lids and his head burrowed beneath
his forearms
Oh boy Rose Thinker called gayly to Tin Philosopher this looks
like the start of a real crisis session Did you remember to bring spare
batteries
Meanwhile the monstrous flight of Puffyloaves filling midwestern skies
as no small fliers had since the days of the passenger pigeon soared
steadily onward
Private fliers approached the brown and glistening breadfront in
curiosity and dipped back in awe Aeroexpresslines organized
sightseeing flights along the flanks Planes of the government forestry
and agricultural services and copters bearing the Puffyloaf emblem
hovered on the fringes watching developments and waiting for orders A
squadron of supersonic fighters hung menacingly above
The behavior of birds varied considerably Most fled or gave the loaves
a wide berth but some bolder species discovering the minimal nutritive
nature of the translucent brown objects attacked them furiously with
beaks and claws Hydrogen diffusing slowly through the crusts had now
distended most of the sealed plastic wrappers into little balloons
which ruptured when pierced with disconcerting pops
Below neckcraning citizens crowded streets and back yards cranks and
cultists had a field day while local and national governments raged
indiscriminately at Puffyloaf and at each other
Rumors that a fusion weapon would be exploded in the midst of the flying
bread drew angry protests from conservationists and a flood of telefax
pamphlets titled HLoaf or Hbomb
Stockholm sent a mystifying note of praise to the United Nations Food
Organization
Delhi issued nervous denials of a millet blight that no one had heard of
until that moment and reaffirmed Indias ability to feed her population
with no outside help except the usual
Radio Moscow asserted that the Kremlin would brook no interference in
its treatment of the Ukrainians jokingly referred to the flying bread
as a farce perpetrated by mad internationalists inhabiting Cloud Cuckoo
Land added contradictory references to airborne bread boobytrapped by
Capitalist gangsters and then fell moodily silent on the whole topic
Radio Venus reported to its winged audience that Earths inhabitants
were establishing food depots in the upper air preparatory to taking up
permanent aerial residence such as we have always enjoyed on Venus
NewNew York made feverish preparations for the passage of the flying
bread Tickets for sightseeing space in skyscrapers were sold at high
prices cold meats and potted spreads were hawked to viewers with the
assurance that they would be able to snag the bread out of the air and
enjoy a historic sandwich
Phineas T Gryce escaping from his own managerial suite raged about
the city demanding general cooperation in the stretching of great nets
between the skyscrapers to trap the errant loaves He was captured by
Tin Philosopher escaped again and was found posted with oxygen mask
and submachine gun on the topmost spire of Puffyloaf Tower apparently
determined to shoot down the loaves as they appeared and before they
involved his company in more trouble with Customs and the State
Department
Recaptured by Tin Philosopher who suffered only minor bullet holes he
was given a series of mild electroshocks and returned to the conference
table calm and clearheaded as ever
Illustration
But the bread flight swinging away from a hurricane moving up the
Atlantic coast crossed a cloudedin Boston by night and disappeared
into a high Atlantic overcast also thereby evading a local storm
generated by the Weather Department in a lastminute effort to bring
down or at least disperse the Hloaves
Warnings and counterwarnings by Communist and Capitalist governments
seriously interfered with military trailing of the flight during this
period and it was actually lost in touch with for several days
At scattered points seagulls were observed fighting over individual
loaves floating down from the gray roofthat was all
A mood of spirituality strongly tinged with humor seized the people of
the world Ministers sermonized about the bread variously interpreting
it as a call to charity a warning against gluttony a parable of the
evanescence of all earthly things and a divine joke Husbands and
wives facing each other across their walls of breakfast toast burst
into laughter The mere sight of a loaf of bread anywhere was enough to
evoke guffaws An obscure sect having as part of its creed the
injunction Dont take yourself so damn seriously won new adherents
The bread flight rising above an Atlantic storm widely reported to have
destroyed it passed unobserved across a foggy England and rose out of
the overcast only over Mitteleuropa The loaves had at last reached
their maximum altitude
The Suns rays beat through the rarified air on the distended plastic
wrappers increasing still further the pressure of the confined
hydrogen They burst by the millions and tens of millions A highflying
Bulgarian evangelist who had happened to mistake the uplever for the
eastlever in the cockpit of his flier and who was the sole witness of
the event afterward described it as the foaming of a sea of diamonds
the crackle of Gods knuckles
By the millions and tens of millions the loaves coasted down into the
starving Ukraine Shaken by a week of humor that threatened to invade
even its own grim precincts the Kremlin made a sudden aboutface A new
policy was instituted of communal ownership of the produce of communal
farms and teams of hungerfighters and caravans of trucks loaded with
pumpernickel were dispatched into the Ukraine
World distribution was given to a series of photographs showing
peasants queueing up to trade scavenged Puffyloaves for traditional
black bread recently aerated itself but still extra solid by
comparison the rate of exchange demanded by the Moscow teams being
twenty Puffyloaves to one of pumpernickel
Another series of photographs picturing chubby workers children being
blown to bits by boobytrapped bread was quietly destroyed
Congratulatory notes were exchanged by various national governments and
world organizations including the Brotherhood of Free Business
Machines The great bread flight was over though for several weeks
afterward scattered falls of loaves occurred giving rise to a new
folklore of manna among lonely Arabian tribesmen and in one
wellauthenticated instance in Tibet sustaining life in a party of
mountaineers cut off by a snow slide
Back in NewNew York the managerial board of Puffy Products slumped in
utter collapse around the conference table the long crisis session at
last ended Empty coffee cartons were scattered around the chairs of the
three humans dead batteries around those of the two machines For a
while there was no movement whatsoever Then Roger Snedden reached out
wearily for the earphones where Megera Winterly had hurled them down
adjusted them to his head pushed a button and listened apathetically
After a bit his gaze brightened He pushed more buttons and listened
more eagerly Soon he was sitting tensely upright on his stool eyes
bright and lower face all asmile muttering terse comments and
questions into the lapel mike torn from Megs fair neck
The others reviving watched him at first dully then with quickening
interest especially when he jerked off the earphones with a happy shout
and sprang to his feet
Listen to this he cried in a ringing voice As a result of the
worldwide publicity Puffyloaves are outselling Fairy Bread three to
oneand thats just the old carbondioxide stock from our freezers
Its almost exhausted but the government now that the Ukrainian crisis
is over has taken the ban off helium and will also sell us stockpiled
wheat if we need it We can have our walking mills burrowing into the
wheat caves in a matter of hours
But that isnt all The far greater demand everywhere is for
Puffyloaves that will actually float Public Relations Child Liaison
Division reports that the kiddies are making their mothers lives
miserable about it If only we can figure out some way to make hydrogen
nonexplosive or the helium loaf float just a little
Im sure we can take care of that quite handily Tin Philosopher
interrupted briskly Puffyloaf has kept it a corporation secreteven
youve never been told about itbut just before he went crazy Everett
Whitehead discovered a way to make bread using only half as much flour
as we do in the present loaf Using this secret technique which weve
been saving for just such an emergency it will be possible to bake a
helium loaf as buoyant in every respect as the hydrogen loaf
Good Roger cried Well tether em on strings and sell em like
balloons No motherchild shopping team will leave the store without a
cluster Buying bread balloons will be the big event of the day for
kiddies Itll make the carryhome shopping load lighter too Ill issue
orders at once
He broke off looking at Phineas T Gryce said with quiet assurance
Excuse me sir if I seem to be taking too much upon myself
Not at all son go straight ahead the great manager said
approvingly Yourehe laughed in anticipation of getting off a
memorable remarkrising to the challenging situation like a genuine
Puffyloaf
Megera Winterly looked from the older man to the younger Then in a
single leap she was upon Roger her arms wrapped tightly around him
My sweet little evervictorious selfpropelled monkey wrench she
crooned in his ear Roger looked fatuously over her soft shoulder at Tin
Philosopher who as if moved by some similar feeling reached over and
touched claws with Rose Thinker
This however was what he telegraphed silently to his fellow machine
across the circuit so completed
Goodo Rosie That makes another victory for robotengineered world
unity though you almost gave us away at the start with that bread
overhead jingle Weve struck another blow against the next world war
in whichas we know only too wellwe machines would suffer the most
Now if we can only arrange say a furfamine in Alaska and a migration
of longhaired Siberian lemmings across Behring Straits  wed have to
swing the Japanese Current up there so itd be warm enough for the
little fellows Anyhow Rosie with a spot of help from the
Brotherhood those humans will paint themselves into the peace corner
yet
Meanwhile he and Rose Thinker quietly watched the Blonde Icicle melt
