I do not know what the public may think of Susan Lenox I

ROBERT W CHAMBERS
BEFORE THE CURTAIN
A few years ago as to the most important and most interesting
subject in the world the relations of the sexes an author had
to choose between silence and telling those distorted truths
beside which plain lying seems almost white and quite harmless
And as no author could afford to be silent on the subject that
underlies all subjects our literature in so far as it
attempted to deal with the most vital phases of human nature
was beneath contempt  The authors who knew they were lying sank
almost as low as the nastynice purveyors of fake idealism and
candied pruriency who fancied they were writing the truth  Now
it almost seems that the day of lying conscious and unconscious
is about run  And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall
make you free
There are three ways of dealing with the sex relations of men
and womentwo wrong and one right
For lack of more accurate names the two wrong ways may be called
respectively the AngloSaxon and the Continental  Both are in
essence processes of spicing up and coloring up perfectly
innocuous facts of nature to make them poisonously attractive to
perverted palates  The wishywashy literature and the
wishywashy morality on which it is based are not one stage
moreor lessrotten than the libertine literature and the
libertine morality on which it is based  So far as degrading
effect is concerned the pure sweet story or play false to
nature false to true morality propagandist of indecent
emotions disguised as idealism need yield nothing to the
socalled strong story  Both pander to different forms of the
same diseased craving for the unnatural  Both produce moral
atrophy  The one tends to encourage the shallow and unthinking
in ignorance of life and so causes them to suffer the merciless
penalties of ignorance  The other tends to miseducate the
shallow and unthinking to give them a ruinously false notion of
the delights of vice  The AngloSaxon morality is like a nude
figure salaciously draped the Continental strength is like a
nude figure salaciously distorted  The AngloSaxon article reeks
the stench of disinfectants the Continental reeks the stench of
degenerate perfume  The Continental shouts Hypocrisy at the
AngloSaxon the AngloSaxon shouts Filthiness at the
Continental  Both are right they are twin sisters of the same
horrid mother  And an author of either allegiance has to have
many a redeeming grace of style of character drawing of
philosophy to gain him tolerance in a clean mind
There is the third and right way of dealing with the sex
relations of men and women  That is the way of simple candor and
naturalness  Treat the sex question as you would any other
question  Dont treat it reverently dont treat it rakishly
Treat it naturally  Dont insult your intelligence and lower
your moral tone by thinking about either the decency or the
indecency of matters that are familiar undeniable and
unchangeable facts of life  Dont look on woman as mere female
but as human being  Remember that she has a mind and a heart as
well as a body  In a sentence dont join in the prurient clamor
of purity hypocrites and strong libertines that exaggerates
and distorts the most commonplace if the most important feature
of life  Let us try to be as sensible about sex as we are trying
to be about all the other phenomena of the universe in this more
enlightened day
Nothing so sweetens a sin or so delights a sinner as getting
bigeyed about it and him  Those of us who are naughty arent
nearly so naughty as we like to think nor are those of us who
are nice nearly so nice  Our virtues and our failings
areperhaps to an unsuspected degreethe result of the
circumstances in which we are placed  The way to improve
individuals is to improve these circumstances and the way to
start at improving the circumstances is by looking honestly and
fearlessly at things as they are  We must know our world and
ourselves before we can know what should be kept and what
changed  And the beginning of this wisdom is in seeing sex
relations rationally  Until that fundamental matter is brought
under the sway of good common sense improvement in other directions
will be slow indeed  Let us stop lyingto othersto ourselves

SUSAN LENOX
CHAPTER I
THE childs dead said Nora the nurse  It was the upstairs
sittingroom in one of the pretentious houses of Sutherland
oldest and most charming of the towns on the Indiana bank of the
Ohio  The two big windows were open their limp and listless
draperies showed that there was not the least motion in the
stifling humid air of the July afternoon  At the center of the
room stood an oblong table over it were neatly spread several
thicknesses of white cotton cloth naked upon them lay the body
of a newborn girl baby  At one side of the table nearer the
window stood Nora  Hers were the hard features and corrugated
skin popularly regarded as the result of a life of toil but in
fact the result of a life of defiance to the laws of health  As
additional penalties for that same selfindulgence she had an
enormous bust and hips thin face and arms hollow
sinewstriped neck  The young man blond and smooth faced at
the other side of the table and facing the light was Doctor
Stevens a recently graduated pupil of the famous Schulze of
Saint Christopher who as much as any other one man is
responsible for the rejection of hocuspocus and the injection
of common sense into American medicine  For upwards of an hour
young Stevens coat off and shirt sleeves rolled to his
shoulders had been toiling with the lifeless form on the table
He had tried everything his training his reading and his
experience suggestedall the more or less familiar devices
similar to those indicated for cases of drowning  Nora had
watched him at first with interest and hope then with interest
alone finally with swiftly deepening disapproval as her
compressed lips and angry eyes plainly revealed  It seemed to
her his effort was degenerating into sacrilege into defiance of
an obvious decree of the Almighty  However she had not ventured
to speak until the young man with a muttered ejaculation
suspiciously like an imprecation straightened his stocky figure
and began to mop the sweat from his face hands and bared arms
When she saw that her verdict had not been heard she repeated
it more emphatically  The childs dead said she as I told
you from the setout She made the sign of the cross on her
forehead and bosom while her fat dry lips moved in a Hail Mary
The young man did not rouse from his reverie  He continued to
gaze with a baffled expression at the tiny form so like a
whimsical caricature of humanity  He showed that he had heard
the womans remark by saying to himself rather than to her
Dead  Whats that  Merely another name for ignorance But the
current of his thought did not swerve  It held to the one
course  What would his master the dauntless the infinitely
resourceful Schulze do if he were confronted by this
intolerable obstacle of a perfect machine refusing to do its
duty and pump vital force through an eagerly waiting body
Hed make it go Id bet my life the young man muttered
Im ashamed of myself
As if the reproach were just the spur his courage and his
intelligence had needed his face suddenly glowed with the
upshooting fire of an inspiration  He thrust the big white
handkerchief into his hip pocket laid one large strong hand
upon the small beautifully arched chest of the baby  Nora
roused by his expression even more than by his gesture gave an
exclamation of horror  Dont touch it again she cried
between entreaty and command  Youve done all you canand more
Stevens was not listening  Such a fine baby too he said
hesitatingthe old woman mistakenly fancied it was her words
that made him pause  I feel no good at all he went on as if
reasoning with himself no good at all losing both the mother
and the child
She didnt want to live replied Nora  Her glances stole
somewhat fearfully toward the door of the adjoining roomthe
bedroom where the mother lay dead
There wasnt nothing but disgrace ahead for both of them
Everybodyll be glad
Such a fine baby muttered the abstracted young doctor
Lovechildren always is said Nora  She was looking sadly and
tenderly down at the tiny symmetrical formsymmetrical to her
and the doctors expert eyes  Such a deep chest she sighed
Such pretty hands and feet  A real lovechild There she
glanced nervously at the doctor it was meet and proper and
pious to speak well of the dead but she felt she might be going
rather far for a good woman
Ill try it cried the young man in a resolute tone  It cant
do any harm and
Without finishing his sentence he laid hold of the body by the
ankles swung it clear of the table  As Nora saw it dangling
head downwards like a dressed suckling pig on a butchers hook
she vented a scream and darted round the table to stop by main
force this revolting desecration of the dead  Stevens called out
sternly  Mind your business Nora  Push the table against the
wall and get out of the way  I want all the room there is
Oh Doctorfor the blessed Jesus sake
Push back that table
Nora shrank before his fierce eyes  She thought his exertions
his disappointment and the heat had combined to topple him over
into insanity  She retreated toward the farther of the open
windows  With a curse at her stupidity Stevens kicked over the
table used his foot vigorously in thrusting it to the wall
Now exclaimed he taking his stand in the center of the room
and gauging the distance of ceiling floor and walls
Nora her back against the window frame her fingers sunk in her
big loose bosom stared petrified  Stevens like an athlete
swinging an indian club whirled the body round and round his
head at the full length of his powerful arms  More and more
rapidly he swung it until his breath came and went in gasps and
the sweat was trickling in streams down his face and neck  Round
and round between ceiling and floor whirled the naked body of
the babyround and round for minutes that seemed hours to the
horrified nurseround and round with all the strength and speed
the young man could put forthround and round until the room
was a blur before his throbbing eyes until his expression
became fully as demoniac as Nora had been fancying it  Just as
she was recovering from her paralysis of horror and was about to
fly shrieking from the room she was halted by a sound that made
her draw in air until her bosom swelled as if it would burst its
gingham prison  She craned eagerly toward Stevens  He was
whirling the body more furiously than ever
Was that you asked Nora hoarsely  Or was it  She paused
listened
The sound came againthe sound of a drowning person fighting for
breath
Itsits muttered Nora  What is it Doctor
Life panted Stevens triumph in his glistening streaming face
Life
He continued to whirl the little form but not so rapidly or so
vigorously  And now the sound was louder or rather less
faint less uncertainwas a crywas the cry of a living thing
Shes alivealive shrieked the woman and in time with his
movements she swayed to and fro from side to side laughing
weeping wringing her hands patting her bosom her cheeks  She
stretched out her arms  My prayers are answered she cried
Dont kill her you brute  Give her to me  You shant treat a
baby that way
The unheeding doctor kept on whirling until the cry was
continuous a low but lusty wail of angry protest  Then he
stopped caught the baby up in both arms burst out laughing
You little minx he saidor rather gaspeda tenderness
quite maternal in his eyes  But I got you  Nora the table
Nora righted the table spread and smoothed the cloths extended
her scrawny eager arms for the baby  Stevens with a jerk of the
head motioned her aside laid the baby on the table  He felt for
the pulse at its wrist bent to listen at the heart  Quite
useless  That strong rising howl of helpless fury was proof
enough  Her majesty the baby was mad through and
throughtherefore alive through and through
Grand heart action said the young man  He stood aloof hands
on his hips head at a proud angle  You never saw a healthier
specimen  Itll be many a year bar accidents before shes that
near death again
But it was Noras turn not to hear  She was soothing and
swaddling the outraged baby  Therethere she crooned
Norall take care of you  The bad man shant come near my
little preciousno the wicked man shant touch her again
The bedroom door opened  At the slight noise superstitious Nora
paled shriveled within her green and white checked gingham  She
slowly turned her head as if on this day of miracles she
expected yet anotherthe resurrection of the resurrected
babys mother poor Miss Lorella But Lorella Lenox was
forever tranquil in the sleep that engulfed her and the sorrows
in which she had been entangled by an impetuous trusting heart
The apparition in the doorway was commonplacethe mistress of
the house Lorellas elder and married sister Fannyneither
fair nor dark neither tall nor short neither thin nor fat
neither pretty nor homely neither stupid nor bright neither
neat nor dowdyone of that multitude of excellent unobtrusive
human beings who make the restful stretches in a world of
agitationsand who respond to the impetus of circumstance as
unresistingly as cloud to wind
As the wail of the child smote upon Fannys ears she lifted her
head startled and cried out sharply Whats that
Weve saved the baby Mrs Warham replied the young doctor
beaming on her through his glasses
Oh said Mrs Warham  And she abruptly seated herself on the
big chintzcovered sofa beside the door
And its a lovely child pleaded Nora  Her womans instinct
guided her straight to the secret of the conflict raging behind
Mrs Warhams unhappy face
The finest girl in the world cried Stevens wellmeaning but tactless
Girl exclaimed Fanny starting up from the sofa  Is it a girl
Nora nodded  The young man looked downcast he was realizing the
practical side of his victory for sciencethe consequences to
the girl child to all the relatives
A girl moaned Fanny sinking to the sofa again  God have mercy on us
Louder and angrier rose the wail  Fanny after a brief struggle
with herself hurried to the table looked down at the tiny
helplessness  Her face softened  She had been a mother four
times  Only one had livedher fair little twoyearold Ruthand
she would never have any more children  The tears glistened in
her eyes  What ails you Nora Mulvey she demanded  Why
arent you tending to this poor little creature
Nora sprang into action but she wrapped the baby herself  The
doctor in deep embarrassment withdrew to the farther window  She
fussed over the baby lingeringly but finally resigned it to the
nurse  Take it into the bathroom she said where everythings
ready to feed itthough I never dreamed  As Nora was about
to depart she detained her  Let me look at it again
The nurse understood that Fanny Warham was searching for
evidence of the mysterious but suspected paternity whose secret
Lorella with true Lenox obstinacy had guarded to the end  The
two women scanned the features  A man would at a glance have
abandoned hope of discovering anything from a chart so vague and
confused as that wrinkled twisted swollen face of the newborn
Not so a woman  Said Nora  She seems to me to favor the
Lenoxes  But I thinkI kind o thinkI see a trace
ofof  There she halted waiting for encouragement
Of Galt suggested Fanny in an undertone
Of Galt assented Nora her tone equally discreet  That nose
is Galtlike and the set of the earsand a kind of something to
the neck and shoulders
Maybe so said Fanny doubtfully  She shook her head drearily
sighed  Whats the use  Lorellas gone  And this morning
General Galt came down to see my husband with a letter hed got
from Jimmie  Jimmie denies it  Perhaps so  Again perhaps the
General wrote him to write that and threatened him if he
didnt  But whats the use  Well never know
And they never did
When young Stevens was leaving George Warham waylaid him at the
front gate separated from the spacious old creeperclad house
by long lawns and an avenue of elms  I hear the childs going
to live said he anxiously
Ive never seen anything more alive replied Stevens
Warham stared gloomily at the ground  He was evidently ashamed
of his feelings yet convinced that they were human and natural
A moments silence between the men then Stevens put his hand on
the gate latch  Diddidmy wife began Warham  Did she
say what she calculated to do
Not a word George After a silence  You know how fond she
is of babies
Yes I know replied Warham  Fanny is a true woman if ever
there was one With a certain defiance And Lorellashe was
a sweet womanly girl
As sweet and good as she was pretty replied Stevens heartily
The way she kept her mouth shut about that hound whoever he
is Warhams Roman face grew savage revealed in startling
apparition a stubborn cruelty of which there was not a trace
upon the surface  If I ever catch the   Ill fill him
full of holes
Hed be lynchedwhoever he is said Stevens
Thats right cried Warham  This is the North but its near
enough to Kentucky to know what to do with a wretch of that
sort His face became calmer  That poor little baby  Hell
have a hard row to hoe
Stevens flushed a guilty red  Itsitsa girl he stammered
Warham stared  A girl he cried  Then his face reddened and
in a furious tone he burst out  Now dont that beat the devil
for luck    A girl  Good Lorda girl
Nobody in this townll blame her consoled Stevens
You know better than that Bob  A girl  Why its downright
wicked    I wonder what Fanny allows to do He showed what
fear was in his mind by wheeling savagely on Stevens with a
stormy We cant keep herwe simply cant
Whats to become of her protested Stevens gently
Warham made a wild vague gesture with both arms  Damn if I
know  Ive got to look out for my own daughter  I wont have it
Damn it I wont have it Stevens lifted the gate latch  Well
Goodby George  Ill look in again this evening And knowing
the moral ideas of the town all he could muster by way of
encouragement was a halfhearted Dont borrow trouble
But Warham did not hear  He was moving up the tanbark walk
toward the house muttering to himself  When Fanny unable
longer to conceal Lorellas plight had told him pity and
affection for his sweet sisterinlaw who had made her home with
them for five years had triumphed over his principles  He had
himself arranged for Fanny to hide Lorella in New York until she
could safely return  But just as the sisters were about to set
out Lorella low in body and in mind fell ill  Then
Georgeand Fanny toohad striven with her to give them the
name of her betrayer that he might be compelled to do her
justice  Lorella refused  I told him she said and heI
never want to see him again They pleaded the disgrace to them
but she replied that he would not marry her even if she would
marry him and she held to her refusal with the firmness for
which the Lenoxes were famous  They suspected Jimmie Galt
because he had been about the most attentive of the young men
until two or three months before and because he had abruptly
departed for Europe to study architecture  Lorella denied that
it was he  If you kill him she said to Warham you kill an
innocent man Warham was so exasperated by her obstinacy that
he was at first for taking her at her offer and letting her go
away  But Fanny would not hear of it and he acquiesced
NowThis child must be sent away off somewhere and never be
heard of again he said to himself  If itd been a boy
perhaps it might have got along  But a girl
Theres nothing can be done to make things right for a girl
thats got no father and no name
The subject did not come up between him and his wife until about
a week after Lorellas funeral  But he was thinking of nothing
else  At his big grocery storewholesale and retailhe sat
morosely in his office brooding over the disgrace and the
danger of deeper disgracefor he saw what a hold the baby
already had upon his wife  He was ashamed to appear in the
streets he knew what was going on behind the sympathetic faces
heard the whisperings as if they had been trumpetings  And he
was as much afraid of his own soft heart as of his wifes  But
for the sake of his daughter he must be firm and just
One morning as he was leaving the house after breakfast he
turned back and said abruptly  Fan dont you think youd
better send the baby away and get it over with
No said his wife unhesitatinglyand he knew his worst
suspicion was correct  Ive made up my mind to keep her
It isnt fair to Ruth
Send it awaywhere
Anywhere  Get it adopted in ChicagoCincinnatiLouisville
Lorellas baby
When she and Ruth grow upwhat then
People aint so low as some think
The sins of the parents are visited on the children unto
I dont care interrupted Fanny  I love her  Im going to
keep her  Wait here a minute
When she came back she had the baby in her arms  Just look
she said softly
George frowned tried not to look but was soon drawn and held by
the sweet fresh blooming face so smooth so winning so innocent
And think how she was sent back to lifefrom beyond the grave
It must have been for some purpose
Warham groaned Oh Lord I dont know what to do  Butit
aint fair to our Ruth
I dont see it that way     Kiss her George
Warham kissed one of the soft cheeks swelling like a ripening
apple  The baby opened wide a pair of wonderful dark eyes threw
up its chubby arms and laughedsuch a laugh    There was no
more talk of sending her away
CHAPTER II
NOT quite seventeen years later on a fine June morning Ruth
Warham issued hastily from the house and started down the long
tanbark walk from the front veranda to the street gate  She was
now nineteennearer twentyand a very pretty young woman
indeed  She had grown up one of those small slender blondes
exquisite and dolllike who cannot help seeming fresh and
sweet whatever the truth about them without or within  This
morning she had on a new summer dress of a blue that matched her
eyes and harmonized with her coloring  She was looking her best
and she had the satisfying confidencegiving sense that it was
so  Like most of the unattached girls of small towns she was
always dreaming of the handsome stranger who would fall in
lovethe thrilling lovestory kind of love at first sight  The
weather plays a conspicuous part in the romancings of youth she
felt that this was precisely the kind of day fate would be most
likely to select for the meeting  Just before dressing she had
been reading about the wonderful himin Robert Chambers
latest storyand she had spent full fifteen minutes of blissful
reverie over the accompanying Fisher illustration  Now she was
issuing hopefully forth as hopefully as if adventure were the
rule and order of life in Sutherland instead of a desperate
monotony made the harder to bear by the glory of its scenery
She had got only far enough from the house to be visible to the
secondstory windows when a young voice called
Ruthie  Arent you going to wait for me
Ruth halted an expression anything but harmonious with the
pretty blue costume stormed across her face  I wont have her
along she muttered  I simply wont She turned slowly and
as she turned effaced every trace of temper with a dexterity
which might have given an onlooker a poorer opinion of her
character than perhaps the facts as to human nature justify  The
countenance she presently revealed to those upper windows was
sunny and sweet  No one was visible but the horizontal slats in
one of the only closed pair of shutters and a vague suggestion
of movement rather than form behind them gave the impression
that a woman not far enough dressed to risk being seen from the
street was hidden there  Evidently Ruth knew for it was toward
this window that she directed her gaze and the remark  Cant
wait dear  Im in a great hurry  Mamma wants the silk right
away and Ive got to match it
But Ill be only a minute pleaded the voicea much more
interesting more musical voice than Ruths rather shrill and
thin high soprano
NoIll meet you up at papas store
All right
Ruth resumed her journey  She smiled to herself  That means
said she half aloud Ill steer clear of the store this morning
But as she was leaving the gate into the wide shady sleepy
street who should come driving past in a village cart but
Lottie Wright  And Lottie reined her pony in to the sidewalk and
in the shade of a symmetrical walnut tree proceeded to invite
Ruth to a dancea long story as Lottie had to tell all about
it the decorations the favors the food who would be there
what she was going to wear and so on and on  Ruth was intensely
interested but kept remembering something that caused her to
glance uneasily from time to time up the tanbark walk under the
arching boughs toward the house  Even if she had not been
interested she would hardly have ventured to break off Lottie
Wright was the only daughter of the richest man in Sutherland
and therefore social arbiter to the younger set
Lottie stopped abruptly said  Well I really must get on  And
theres your cousin coming down the walk  I know youve been
waiting for her
Ruth tried to keep in countenance but a blush of shame and a
frown of irritation came in spite of her
Im sorry I cant ask Susie too pursued Lottie in a voice
of hypocritical regret  But there are to be exactly eighteen
couplesand I couldnt
Of course not said Ruth heartily  Susanll understand
I wouldnt for the world do anything to hurt her feelings
continued Lottie with the selfcomplacent righteousness of a
deacon telling the congregation how good grace has made him
Her prominent commonplace brown eyes were gazing up the walk an
expression distressingly like envious anger in them  She had a
thick pudgy face an oily skin an outcropping of dull red
pimples on the chin  Many women can indulge their passion for
sweets at meals and sweets between meals without serious
injuryto complexion Lottie Wright unluckily couldnt
I feel sorry for Susie she went on in the ludicrous
patronizing tone that needs no describing to anyone acquainted
