INTRODUCTION
Among other things the licensing act of 1737 stipulated that Covent
Garden and Drury Lane exclusively were the patented and licensed
theaters respectively in London a fact directly related to the revolt
of prestigious players six years later Although there were sporadic
performances of legitimate drama in unlicensed playhouses between 1737
and 1743 fulltime professional actors and actresses were in effect
locked into the approved theaters during the regular theatrical season
Suspecting a cartel directed against them personally and professionally
by the Bashas Rich at Covent Garden and Fleetwood at Drury Lane1
the players from Drury Lane in the summer of 1743 banded together and
refused to perform the next season until salaries and playing conditions
improved Tardy and partial payment of salary was the surface sore
point unprincipled and unwarranted manipulation by the managers the
underlying one As the MacklinGarrick quarrel attests2 the conflict
was not only between labor and management but the latter confrontation
is central to the conflict in 1743 and the subject of The Case of Mrs
Clive Submitted to the Publick published in October 1744 by which
time Catherine Kitty Clive had established herself as not only first
lady of comedy but also as somewhat of a patriot of the acting
profession and the Drury Lane company
Coming to Drury Lane in 1728 while still in her teens Kitty Rafter
17111785 quickly became a favorite of the town by virtue of her
singing voice vivacity and gift for mimicry Admired first as a
singing actress Miss Rafter in 1731 gave unequivocal notice of her
considerable talent as a comic actress in the role of Nell in Coffeys
The Devil to Pay one of several hundred she mastered Her
specialties Flora in The Wonder Lady Bab in High Life Below
Stairs Lappet in The Miser Catherine in Catherine and Petruchio
Mrs Heidelberg in The Clandestine Marriage and the Fine Lady in
Lethe Mrs Clives on 4 Oct 1733 Miss Rafter married George Clive
a barrister popularity as comedienne and performer of prologues and
epilogues is indicated by the frequency of her performances and long
tenure at Drury Lane she retired in 1769 and documented by the
panegyrics of Fielding Murphy Churchill Garrick Dr Johnson Horace
Walpole Goldsmith fellow players contemporary memoir writers and
audiences who admired her3 Dr Johnson I feel gives the most
balanced just contemporary appraisal of Mrs Clive the actress What
Clive did best she did better than Garrick but could not do half so
many things well she was a better romp than any I ever saw in
nature4 Part of the half she could not do well were tragedy roles
attested to by Thomas Davies who comments on her performances as
Ophelia in Hamlet and Zara in The Mourning Bride Of Mrs Clives
Ophelia I shall only say that I regret that the first comic actress in
the world should so far mistake her talents as to attempt it And on
Zara for her own benefit the comic Clive put on the royal robes of
Zara she found them too heavy and very wisely never wore them
afterwards5 Part of the half she could do well is noticed once
again by Davies particularly adroit and distinguished in chambermaid
parts Mrs Clive
excelled also in characters of caprice and affectation from the
highbred Lady Fanciful to the vulgar Mrs Heidelberg in country
girls romps hoydens and dowdies superannuated beauties viragos
and humourists she had an inimitable talent in ridiculing the
extravagant action and impertinent consequence of an
Operasingerof which she gave an excellent specimen in Lethe
Her mirth was so genuine that whether it was restrained to the arch
sneer and suppressed halflaugh or extended to the downright
honest burst of loud laughter the audience was sure to accompany
her my punctuation6
Mrs Clives stature as a comic actress would then seemingly make her
a prize for Rich or Fleetwood but they did their best to thwart her
career and happiness at their theaters
I suspect that their motivation in so doing was fear that her temper
her influence with other actors and her audiences and her strong
loyalty to her profession would hinder their legislated power to control
absolutely London theaters players and audiences in 1743 Not much
investigation is required to see Mrs Clive at her clamoring best at
various times head to head with Susannah Cibber Peg Woffington
Woodward Shuter or Garrick Her letters to Garrick show that as late
as the sixties she was quite capable of vitriol when she felt that she
or her friends were unjustly treated Tate Wilkinson was surely correct
in describing her as a mixture of combustibles she was passionate
cross and vulgar often simultaneously7 If this were the case in
mere greenroom tiffs or casual correspondence how the ire of the
Clive must have been excited by the cartelists who did their utmost to
keep her out of joint and almost out of sight
In 1733 Fielding who furthered Mrs Clives career by writing and
editing parts of his plays for her and publicly praising her as a woman
and as an actress wrote the following encomium on her professional
integrity in his Epistle to Mrs Clive prefatory to The Intriguing
Chambermaid
The part you have maintained in the present dispute between the
players and the patentees is so full of honour that had it been
in higher life it would have given you the reputation of the
greatest heroine of the age You looked on the cases of Mr
Highmore and Mrs Wilks with compassion nor could any promises or
views of interest sway you to desert them nor have you scrupled
any fatigue  to support the cause of those whom you imagine
injured and distressed and for this you have been so far from
endeavouring to exact an exorbitant reward from persons little able
to afford it that I have known you to offer to act for nothing
rather than the patentees should be injured by the dismission of
the audience8
Fielding is of course referring to the 1733 dispute in which Mrs
Clive and Macklin among the principal players stayed with the
ineffective proprietor of Drury Lane John Highmore Jealous that
Highmore and not he gained control of Drury Lane after former
shareholders either died or sold out Theophilus Cibber demanded among
other things that Highmore share profits with his players rather than
pay fixed salaries He then led the Drury Lane players in revolt in the
autumn of 1733 to the New Haymarket where they played without a license
until March of the 17331734 season at which time they returned to
Drury Lane under the new management of Fleetwood The actors at least
partially won this battle and although Highmore tried to have the
vagrant act enforced the players returned to Drury Lane unscathed With
Highmore gone a period of uneasy peace obtained The players however
were not to win so easily the next dispute the one that took place
after the passage of the licensing act9
Mrs Clives decision to stay with Highmore rather than defect was
probably made because two womenMrs Wilks the widow of her Kittys
old theatrical idol and Mrs Boothwere in he direction of the
theater10 But in light of Fieldings words and her actions and
statements in regard to the welfare of Drury Lane and its actors
throughout her career I believe that Mrs Clive although not pleased
with aspects of Highmores reign also refused to defect because she
felt that the manager was basically in the right that her fellow
players would be destitute or at least open to hardship without
employment there and that the audiences would take offense at such
unprofessional and selfish behavior from their servants The Town
as her own play The Rehearsal Ii 159170 shows was always her
judge in matters professional
Fieldings prologue to his revised Authors Farce 1734 spoken by
Mrs Clive compares the settled prosperous former days at Drury Lane
with those of 1734 when  alas how alterd is our Case I view
with Tears this poor deserted Place11 With few exceptions the
place continued strangely in decline even with a competent company and
often with a full house The fallingoff continued until the advent of
Garrick who with Lacy in 1747 comanaged the theater into a new era
From the midthirties until 1743 Mrs Clive appears in roles she had
made famous as well as those newly written with her particular talents
in mind Fielding turning more and more to political satire and soon to
another literary form had little need of her services12 but others
did and the years between the licensing act and 1743 find Mrs Clive in
demand as the affected lady of quality speaker of humorous epilogues
performer in Dublin and singer of such favorites as EllenaRoon
The Cuckoo and The Life of a Beau This period is also marked by
Mrs Clives first professional venture with David Garrick in his
Lethe the beginning of a relationship to become one of the most
tempestuous and fruitful in all theater history
As I intimated at the outset the licensing act mainly troubled the
London players because of the power of monopoly it invested in Fleetwood
and Rich Not only were the forums for dramatic presentation now
restricted but so was professional freedom The problem therefore was
as much philosophical as it was geographical From the sixteenth century
to 1737 English players had some freedom albeit limited to rebel from
intolerable authority and to form their own company13 This freedom
this choice as Lord Chesterfield pointed out in his speech against the
act was severely attenuated in 1737 and was to remain so in varying
degrees until the monopoly the act allowed was legislated dead in 1843
But it was a cartel between the managers that the players most feared
and there is evidence in the pamphlets growing out of the struggle of
1743 that such a fear was wellfounded
The playing conditions at Drury Lane in the early forties were not good
a situation directly attributable to the ineptitude and highhandedness
of Fleetwood and his treasurer Pierson and his refusal to pay salaries
in full and on time The managers accommodating sideshow performers in
his company did not help Macklin as Fleetwoods lieutenant had to try
to pacify actors workmen creditors as actor he commiserated with the
players With the coming of Garrick from Goodmans Fields to Drury Lane
late in the 17411742 season and with a progressively disgruntled Clive
all the principals in the revolt are under oneleakyroof
In light of the number and variety of the published commentary which
accompanied the revolt perhaps a highlighting of Clives Case would
be the most efficient way to elucidate some of the major difficulties
involved After addressing herself to the Favour of the Publick with
encouragement from her friends14 Mrs Clive strikes the key note of
her essay injustice and oppression specifically seen in the cartels
threat to Custom an iterative word throughout the essay Mrs Clive
first speaks of salary a matter obviously important to her Liberty and
Livelihood15 One writer on the dispute in a quasisatirical tract
denounces the managers in this regard and in so doing echoes Mrs Clive
When there are but two Theatres allowed of shall the Masters of those
two Houses league together and oblige the Actors either to take what
Salary or Treatment they graciously vouchsafe to offer them and to be
parcelled out and confined to this House or tother just as they in
their Wisdoms think meet or else to be banished the Kingdom for a
Livelihood This is Tyranny with a Vengeancebut perhaps these generous
noblespirited Masters may intend their Performers a Compliment in it
and by thus fixing them to one Place effectually wipe off that odious
Appellation of Vagabonds which has been sometimes given them16 The
licensing act subsequent cartel and mistreatment of players were then
not only in the mind of Mrs Clive Treated in most of the arguments for
or against the players was salary but it was only a cover hiding an
underlying malaise
Implying that the managers set out to ruin certain performers including
herself Mrs Clive accuses them of putting on a better Face to the
Town by publishing inaccurate salary figuresa ploy to get public
sanction for lower salaries Mrs Clive alludes to salaries published
ostensibly by Fleetwood in the papers eg Gentlemans Magazine
XIII October 1743 553 where the pay of such lights as Garrick
Macklin Pritchard and Clive in the 17421743 season is made to seem
higher than the salaries of such worthies as Wilks Betterton Cibber
and Oldfield in the 17081709 season The actors in presenting their
case Gentlemans Magazine XIII November 1743 609 hit at
Fleetwood for citing 17081709 salaries for the Stage then both of
DruryLane and the Haymarket were in so wretched a Condition
as not to be worth any bodys Acceptance The players use instead
salaries of the 1729 players to place the salaries of the present
Actors in a true light since the stage in that year flourished In
1729 Wilks the highest paid actor earned more than his later equal
Garrick All other principals salaries were comparable
The main complaint of Fleetwoods company then was not only base
salary but the Fallacy of the managers account and his setting down
besides the Managers Charges every benefit Night what is got by the
Actors own private Interests in Money and Tickets as also the Article
of 50L for Cloaths added to the Actresses Account which is absolutely
an Advantage to the Manager as they always lay out considerably more
This evidence if not in itself damning to Fleetwoods designs toward
his actors at least indicates the internecine breach at Drury Lane
The intertheater conflict important for its effect on repertory and
morale is adequately examined in theater histories and lies outside my
interests in this essay
Mrs Clive admits however that reduced unpaid or handled salaries
were not the first fear of the actors it was instead she says the
fear of what would happen from an Agreement supposed to be concluded
betwixt the two Managers which made em apprehend that if they
submitted to act under such Agreements they must be absolutely in the
Managers Power As the writer of The Case Between the Managers p
11 presents it a conversation between a personified Covent Garden and
Drury Lane would have gone like this Well but Brother Drury we
can manage that matter how to keep audiencesSuppose you and I make a
Cartel for instance agree for every other Theatre and oblige
ourselves by this Cartel to reduce by near one half the Salaries of our
principal PerformersIgad we may cramp em rarely this waythey must
serve us at any rate we tax their Merit at for theyll then have no
where else to go to Drury Lane responds Dn me if that is not
divinely thoughtmy dear Friend give me a Kiss
Late in the summer of 1743 several months before the salary figures
described above Garrick Macklin Clive and Mrs Pritchard among the
principal players attempted to obtain another license to set up their
own company in the Haymarket shades of 1733 They applied to the
Chamberlain Graftonwho denied it in part perhaps because put out that
Garrick commanded over L500 a year There was no chance therefore to
sidestep the monopoly effected by the licensing act Leading the
secession Garrick agreed with his colleagues to stay out until redress
was forthcoming Redress did not come the defectors lost Fleetwood
won He starved them in not out Garrick was persuaded to return to
Drury Lane which he does in early December 1743 by the entreaties of
several of the destitute seceded players who asked him to accede to
Fleetwoods terms As Garrick explains to Macklin see note 2 he did
so because he had the economic welfare of his fellow actors at heart
Macklin infuriated with him and Clive disappointed in him both refused
to accept Garricks decision and hence became renegade Macklin
uninvited back by Fleetwood admired Olives decision to have no part in
signing a petition presented to her by her fellow defectors who
understood that the refusal of a separate license dissolved their bond
Macklin writes in his Reply to Mr Garricks Answer p 27 that it
ought to be known that when this Letter was carried to Mrs Clive and
her Name to it desired she had the Honour and Spirit to refuse upon
any Consideration to be made so ridiculous a Tool to so base a
Purpose
Others were not so generous as Macklin The author of The Disputes
between the Director of Dy and the Pit Potentates one BY
champions the cause of the nonprincipal players against such as Mrs
Clive for the lowsalaryd Players are always at the labouring Oar
and at constant Expence while the rest are servd up once or twice in a
Week each as very fine Dishes one of whom he says is Mrs Clive an
avaritious person whom he is confident has found and feels her
Error by this Time17 The writer then details the particular
hardships of Mrs Roberts Mrs Horton and Mr Mills hardships caused
by such greedy principals as Clive BY obviously chose to ignore the
compassion of Mrs Clive for the lowsalaried players expressed in her
Case
Evidence that Mrs Clive was in no position to be avaricious and that a
debilitating cartel in fact existed is found in her own essay When the
defected players returned to Drury Lane except Macklin whom Fleetwood
considered the cause of the theaters troubles late in 1743 Fleetwood
offered Mrs Clive a salary incompatible with her talent and lower than
his previous agreements with her Clive says They were such as I was
advisd not to accept because it was known they were proposed for no
reason but to insult me and make me seek for better at the other
Theatre for I knew it had been settled by some dark Agreement that
Part of the Actors were to go to CoventGarden Theatre and others to
DruryLane
Led to believe that she would find comfort and acceptance at Covent
Garden based on previous encouragement by Rich to have her join his
company18 Mrs Clive realized that the dark agreement was a fact for
When I applyd to him he offered me exactly the same which I had
refused at the other Theatre She managed a bit more salary however
and out of necessity agreed to play More rankling to Mrs Clive than
basic salary was her being forced to pay for her benefit The extant
CliveGarrick correspondence points to the pride she took in not only a
clear benefit but one held during that part of the month she dictated
As is the case with salary the basis for this complaint was
unreasonable manipulation by the managers loss of freedom and an
unjustified break with tradition I had had one a benefit clear of
all Expence for Nine Years before an Advantage the first Performers had
been thought to merit for near Thirty Years and had grown into a
Custom
Mrs Clive did not regularly play for Rich until December 1743 from
which time she determined to stay there doing all in her power to
please her audiences and him Yet she found by his Behaviour to me it
was designed I should not continue with him Clives specific
exposition of Richs mistreatment of her is a portrait of an actress
aware of her worth and of a manager at his worst Fired from Covent
Gardenagainst custom and justiceat the end of the season without
being told Mrs Clive could not arrange to play in Ireland where she
was a great favorite19 for Richs cheat did not become clear to her
until summer was too far advanced Clive says it all when she observes
it is unlawful to act any where but with them Fleetwood was the only
alternative for the next season and he still owed her A160 12s At the
time of Clives Case October 1744 Fleetwood had not yet contacted her
for engagement at Drury Lane even though he could not but know I am
disengagd from the other Theatre Nor could have Clive expected much
of a salary from him even if he did call on her since the last season he
offered her not near half as much as he afterwards agreed to give
another Performer and less than he then gave to some others in his
Company Mrs Clive could not but conclude that the managers were in
league to distress her20 In the final third of her essay Mrs Clive
presents a rather touching account of the personal costs of a piece of
legislation which was itself manipulated and interpreted in the narrow
sense of forming the legal safeguard to the patent monopoly21
The Ladies who had promised their protection to Mrs Clive obviously
were influential in convincing Rich to rehire her for less than one
month after the appearance of Clives Case the Prince of Wales and his
Princess sponsored at the Haymarket a concert for her benefit22 and
her name is regularly listed in the Covent Garden playbills soon after
The absence of publicity from Mrs Clive or about her suggests that
her second short year at Covent Garden was fairly acceptable to all
concerned although Portia in The Merchant of Venice was hardly her
forte
The next season finds her back at Drury Lane where she reigns
uncontested queen of comedy for more than twenty years In addition to
the return of Clive the 17451746 season one poor in attendance and
new plays at Drury Lane is noteworthy because of a reinstated Macklin
a dethroned Fleetwood a new manager Lacy a wellbalanced company
soon to be augmented by playermanager Garrick prospects for a bright
futureand a theatrical monopoly stronger than ever23 In the latter
regard Mrs Clives case is revealing in that it gives a new emphasis to
the epithet His Majesties Servants24

THE CASE OF MRS CLIVE
Submitted to the PUBLICK
In order to put an End to Aome falAe Reports which have been raiAed in
Relation to my not acting this SeaAon as well as to beApeak the Favour
of the Publick I have by the Advice of my Friends ventured to addreAs
my Aelf to them from whom I have received many and great Marks of
Favour and whoAe further Protection I now Atand in need of
I know Appeals of this Nature which relate to DiAputes that happen at a
Theatre are by Aome thought preAuming and impertinent AuppoAing they
are too trifling to demand Attention But as I perAuade my Aelf that
InjuAtice and OppreAAion are by no means thought Matters of Indifference
by any who have Humanity I hope I Ahall not be thought to take too
great a Liberty I am the more encouraged to hope this from Experience
it having been obAerved that thoAe Performers who have had the
HappineAs to pleaAe on the Stage and who never did any thing to offend
the Publick whenever they have been injured by thoAe who preAided over
Theatres have Aeldom if ever failed of RedreAs upon repreAenting the
HardAhips they met with And as I at this time apprehend my Aelf to
be greatly oppreAAed by the Managers of both Theatres I hope I Ahall be
juAtified in taking this Method of acquainting the Publick with my CaAe
Aubmitting it to their Determination
Before the DiAputes happened betwixt the Manager of DruryLane Theatre
and his Actors I had articled for Five Years to receive Three Hundred
Pounds a Year tho another Performer on that Stage received for Seven
Years Five Hundred Guineas per Year and at the Expiration of my
Agreements the Manager offered me an additional Salary to continue at
that Theatre
And Aince I have mentioned thoAe DiAputes which ended Ao greatly to the
DiAadvantage of the Actors I muAt beg Leave to endeavour to Aet that
Matter in a clear Light which hitherto has been miArepreAented to the
Publick I think my Aelf obliged to this as the HardAhips I at preAent
labour under are owing to that DiAagreement if any think I treat this
Matter too AeriouAly I hope they will remember that however trifling
Auch Things may appear to them to me who am Ao much concerned in em
they are of great Importance Auch as my Liberty and Livelihood depend
on
As only two Theatres were authoriAed the Managers thought it was in
their Power to reduce the Incomes of thoAe Performers who could not
live independant of their ProfeAAion but in order to make this appear
with a better Face to the Town it was agreed to complain of the Actors
Salaries being too great and accordingly a falAe Account was publiAhed
of them in the daily Papers by whom I will not Aay Whether or no
Aome particular Salaries were Ao I will not pretend to determine yet
in the whole they did not amount to more than had been allowed for
many Years when the Theatre was under a frugal and exact Regulation
when the Managers punctually fulfilled not only all Engagements to
their Actors but to every other PerAon concerned in the Theatre and
raiAed very conAiderable Fortunes for themAelves
But AuppoAing the Expence of the Theatre too high I am very certain it
was not the Actors refuAing to Aubmit to a proper Reduction of them
which made Ao many of them quit the Stage but from great HardAhips they
underwent and greater which they feared would happen from an Agreement
AuppoAed to be concluded betwixt the two Managers which made em
apprehend that if they Aubmitted to act under Auch Agreements they
muAt be abAolutely in the Managers Power and the Event has proved that
their Fears were not illgrounded as I doubt not but I Ahall make
appear
When the Actors Affairs obliged em to return to the Theatres laAt
Winter under Auch Abatements of their Salaries as hardly afforded the
greater Part of them a SubAiAtence I was offered by the Manager of
DruryLane Theatre Auch Terms as bore no Proportion to what he gave
