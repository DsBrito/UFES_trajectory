regard it as a curious phenomenon in the fortunes of the individual
that the progress of his fame as a poet should have been so similar
to his history as a man
His first attempts though displaying both originality and power
were received with a contemptuous disdain as cold and repulsive as
the penury and neglect which blighted the budding of his youth  The
unjust ridicule in the review of his first poems excited in his
spirit a discontent as inveterate as the feeling which sprung from
his deformity  it affected more or less all his conceptions to
such a degree that he may be said to have hated the age which had
joined in the derision as he cherished an antipathy against those
persons who looked curiously at his foot  Childe Harold the most
triumphant of his works was produced when the world was kindliest
disposed to set a just value on his talents and his latter
productions in which the faults of his taste appear the broadest
were written when his errors as a man were harshest in the public
voice
These allusions to the incidents of a life full of contrarieties and
a character so strange as to be almost mysterious sufficiently show
the difficulties of the task I have undertaken  But the course I
intend to pursue will relieve me from the necessity of entering in
any particular manner upon those debatable points of his personal
conduct which have been so much discussed  I shall consider him if
I can as his character will be estimated when contemporary surmises
are forgotten and when the monument he has raised to himself is
contemplated for its beauty and magnificence without suggesting
recollections of the eccentricities of the builder

CHAPTER I
Ancient DescentPedigreeBirthTroubles of his MotherEarly
EducationAccession to the Title
The English branch of the family of Byron came in with William the
Conqueror and from that era they have continued to be reckoned among
the eminent families of the kingdom under the names of Buron and
Biron  It was not until the reign of Henry II that they began to
call themselves Byron or de Byron
Although for upwards of seven hundred years distinguished for the
extent of their possessions it docs not appear that before the
time of Charles I they ranked very highly among the heroic families
of the kingdom
Erneis and Ralph were the companions of the Conqueror but
antiquaries and genealogists have not determined in what relation
they stood to each other  Erneis who appears to have been the more
considerable personage of the two held numerous manors in the
counties of York and Lincoln  In the Domesday Book Ralph the
direct ancestor of the poet ranks high among the tenants of the
Crown in Notts and Derbyshire in the latter county he resided at
Horestan Castle from which he took his title  One of the lords of
Horestan was a hostage for the payment of the ransom of Richard Coeur
de Lion and in the time of Edward I the possessions of his
descendants were augmented by the addition of the Manor of Rochdale
in Lancashire  On what account this new grant was given has not been
ascertained nor is it of importance that it should be
In the wars of the three Edwards the de Byrons appeared with some
distinction and they were also of note in the time of Henry V  Sir
John Byron joined Henry VII on his landing at Milford and fought
gallantly at the battle of Bosworth against Richard III for which
he was afterwards appointed Constable of Nottingham Castle and Warden
of Sherwood Forest  At his death in 1488 he was succeeded by Sir
Nicholas his brother who at the marriage of Arthur Prince of
Wales in 1501 was made one of the Knights of the Bath
Sir Nicholas died in 1540 leaving an only son Sir John Byron whom
Henry VIII made Steward of Manchester and Rochdale and Lieutenant
of the Forest of Sherwood  It was to him that on the dissolution of
the monasteries the church and priory of Newstead in the county of
Nottingham together with the manor and rectory of Papelwick were
granted  The abbey from that period became the family seat and
continued so until it was sold by the poet
Sir John Byron left Newstead and his other possessions to John Byron
whom Collins and other writers have called his fourth but who was in
fact his illegitimate son  He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in
1579 and his eldest son Sir Nicholas served with distinction in
the wars of the Netherlands  When the great rebellion broke out
against Charles I he was one of the earliest who armed in his
defence  After the battle of Edgehill where he courageously
distinguished himself he was made Governor of Chester and gallantly
defended that city against the Parliamentary army  Sir John Byron
the brother and heir of Sir Nicholas was at the coronation of James
I made a Knight of the Bath  By his marriage with Anne the eldest
daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux he had eleven sons and a daughter
The eldest served under his uncle in the Netherlands and in the year
1641 was appointed by King Charles I Governor of the Tower of
London  In this situation he became obnoxious to the refractory
spirits in the Parliament and was in consequence ordered by the
Commons to answer at the bar of their House certain charges which the
sectaries alleged against him  But he refused to leave his post
without the kings command and upon this the Commons applied to the
Lords to join them in a petition to the king to remove him  The
Peers rejected the proposition
On the 24th October 1643 Sir John Byron was created Lord Byron of
Rochdale in the county of Lancaster with remainder of the title to
his brothers and their male issue respectively  He was also made
FieldMarshalGeneral of all his Majestys forces in Worcestershire
Cheshire Shropshire and North Wales  nor were these trusts and
honours unwon for the Byrons during the Civil War were eminently
distinguished  At the battle of Newbury seven of the brothers were
in the field and all actively engaged
Sir Richard the second brother of the first lord was knighted by
Charles I for his conduct at the battle of Edgehill and appointed
Governor of Appleby Castle in Westmorland and afterwards of Newark
which he defended with great honour  Sir Richard on the death of
his brother in 1652 succeeded to the peerage and died in 1679
His eldest son William the third lord married Elizabeth the
daughter of Viscount Chaworth of Ireland by whom he had five sons
four of whom died young  William the fourth lord his son was
Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Prince George of Denmark and married
for his first wife a daughter of the Earl of Bridgewater who died
eleven weeks after their nuptials  His second wife was the daughter
of the Earl of Portland by whom he had three sons who all died
before their father  His third wife was Frances daughter of Lord
Berkley of Stratton from whom the poet was descended  Her eldest
son William born in 1722 succeeded to the family honours on the
death of his father in 1736  He entered the naval service and
became a lieutenant under Admiral Balchen  In the year 1763 he was
made Master of the Staghounds and in 1765 he was sent to the Tower
and tried before the House of Peers for killing his relation and
neighbour Mr Chaworth in a duel fought at the Star and Garter
Tavern in Pallmall
This Lord William was naturally boisterous and vindictive  It
appeared in evidence that he insisted on fighting with Mr Chaworth in
the room where the quarrel commenced  They accordingly fought
without seconds by the dim light of a single candle and although Mr
Chaworth was the more skilful swordsman of the two he received a
mortal wound but he lived long enough to disclose some particulars
of the rencounter which induced the coroners jury to return a
verdict of wilful murder and Lord Byron was tried for the crime
The trial took place in Westminster Hall and the public curiosity
was so great that the Peers tickets of admission were publicly sold
for six guineas each  It lasted two days and at the conclusion he
was unanimously pronounced guilty of manslaughter  On being brought
up for judgment he pleaded his privilege and was discharged  It was
to this lord that the poet succeeded for he died without leaving
issue
His brother the grandfather of the poet was the celebrated Hardy
Byron or as the sailors called him Foulweather Jack whose
adventures and services are too well known to require any notice
here  He married the daughter of John Trevannion Esq of Carhais
in the county of Cornwall by whom he had two sons and three
daughters  John the eldest and the father of the poet was born in
1751 educated at Westminster School and afterwards placed in the
Guards where his conduct became so irregular and profligate that his
father the admiral though a goodnatured man discarded him long
before his death  In 1778 he acquired extraordinary eclat by the
seduction of the Marchioness of Caermarthen under circumstances
which have few parallels in the licentiousness of fashionable life
The meanness with which he obliged his wretched victim to supply him
with money would have been disgraceful to the basest adulteries of
the cellar or garret  A divorce ensued the guilty parties married
but within two years after such was the brutal and vicious conduct
of Captain Byron that the illfated lady died literally of a broken
heart after having given birth to two daughters one of whom still
survives
Captain Byron then married Miss Catharine Gordon of Gight a lady of
honourable descent and of a respectable fortune for a Scottish
heiress the only motive which this Don Juan had for forming the
connection  She was the mother of the poet
Although the Byrons have for so many ages been among the eminent
families of the realm they have no claim to the distinction which
the poet has set up for them as warriors in Palestine even though he
says
Near Ascalons towrs John of Horestan slumbers
for unless this refers to the Lord of Horestan who was one of the
hostages for the ransom of Richard I it will not be easy to
determine to whom he alludes and it is possible that the poet has no
other authority for this legend than the tradition which he found
connected with two groups of heads on the old panels of Newstead
Yet the account of them is vague and conjectural for it was not
until ages after the Crusades that the abbey came into the possession
of the family and it is not probable that the figures referred to
any transactions in Palestine in which the Byrons were engaged if
they were put up by the Byrons at all  They were probably placed in
their present situation while the building was in possession of the
Churchmen
One of the groups consisting of a female and two Saracens with eyes
earnestly fixed upon her may have been the old favourite
ecclesiastical story of Susannah and the elders the other which
represents a Saracen with a European female between him and a
Christian soldier is perhaps an ecclesiastical allegory
descriptive of the Saracen and the Christian warrior contending for
the liberation of the Church  These sort of allegorical stories were
common among monastic ornaments and the famous legend of St George
and the Dragon is one of them
Into the domestic circumstances of Captain and Mrs Byron it would be
impertinent to institute any particular investigation  They were
exactly such as might be expected from the sins and follies of the
most profligate libertine of the age
The fortune of Mrs Byron consisting of various property and
amounting to about 23500 pounds was all wasted in the space of two
years at the end of which the unfortunate lady found herself in
possession of only 150 pounds per annum
Their means being thus exhausted she accompanied her husband in the
summer of 1786 to France whence she returned to England at the close
of the year 1787 and on the 22nd of January 1788 gave birth in
Holles Street London to her first and only child the poet  The
name of Gordon was added to that of his family in compliance with a
condition imposed by will on whomever should become the husband of
the heiress of Gight  The late Duke of Gordon and Colonel Duff of
Fetteresso were godfathers to the child
In the year 1790 Mrs Byron took up her residence in Aberdeen where
she was soon after joined by Captain Byron with whom she lived in
lodgings in Queen Street but their reunion was comfortless and a
separation soon took place  Still their rupture was not final for
they occasionally visited and drank tea with each other  The Captain
also paid some attention to the boy and had him on one occasion to
stay with him for a night when he proved so troublesome that he was
sent home next day
Byron himself has said that he passed his boyhood at Marlodge near
Aberdeen but the statement is not correct he visited with his
mother occasionally among their friends and among other places
passed some time at Fetteresso the seat of his godfather Colonel
Duff  In 1796 after an attack of the scarlet fever he passed some
time at Ballater a summer resort for health and gaiety about forty
miles up the Dee from Aberdeen  Although the circumstances of Mrs
Byron were at this period exceedingly straitened she received a
visit from her husband the object of which was to extort more money
and he was so far successful that she contrived to borrow a sum
which enabled him to proceed to Valenciennes where in the following
year he died greatly to her relief and the gratification of all who
were connected with him
By her advances to Captain Byron and the expenses she incurred in
furnishing the flat of the house she occupied after his death Mrs
Byron fell into debt to the amount of 300 pounds the interest on
which reduced her income to 135 pounds but much to her credit she
contrived to live without increasing her embarrassments until the
death of her grandmother when she received 1122 pounds a sum which
had been set apart for the old gentlewomans jointure and which
enabled her to discharge her pecuniary obligations
Notwithstanding the manner in which this unfortunate lady was treated
by her husband she always entertained for him a strong affection
insomuch that when the intelligence of his death arrived her grief
was loud and vehement  She was indeed a woman of quick feelings and
strong passions and probably it was by the strength and sincerity of
her sensibility that she retained so long the affection of her son
towards whom it cannot be doubted that her love was unaffected  In
the midst of the neglect and penury to which she was herself
subjected she bestowed upon him all the care the love and
watchfulness of the tenderest mother
In his fifth year on the 19th of November 1792 she sent him to a
dayschool where she paid about five shillings a quarter the common
rate of the respectable dayschools at that time in Scotland  It was
kept by a Mr Bowers whom Byron has described as a dapper spruce
person with whom he made no progress  How long he remained with Mr
Bowers is not mentioned but by the daybook of the school it was at
least twelve months for on the 19th of November of the following
year there is an entry of a guinea having been paid for him
From this school he was removed and placed with a Mr Ross one of the
ministers of the city churches and to whom he formed some
attachment as he speaks of him with kindness and describes him as a
devout clever little man of mild manners goodnatured and
painstaking  His third instructor was a serious saturnine kind
young man named Paterson the son of a shoemaker but a good scholar
and a rigid Presbyterian  It is somewhat curious in the record which
Byron has made of his early years to observe the constant endeavour
with which he the descendant of such a limitless pedigree and great
ancestors attempts to magnify the condition of his mothers
circumstances
Paterson attended him until he went to the grammarschool where his
character first began to be developed and his schoolfellows many of
whom are alive still recollect him as a lively warmhearted and
highspirited boy passionate and resentful but withal affectionate
and companionable this however is an opinion given of him after he
had become celebrated for a very different impression has
unquestionably remained among some who carry their recollections back
to his childhood  By them he has been described as a malignant imp
was often spoken of for his pranks by the worthy housewives of the
neighbourhood as Mrs Byrons crockit deevil and generally
disliked for the deep vindictive anger he retained against those with
whom he happened to quarrel
By the death of William the fifth lord he succeeded to the estates
and titles in the year 1798 and in the autumn of that year Mrs
Byron with her son and a faithful servant of the name of Mary Gray
left Aberdeen for Newstead  Previously to their departure Mrs Byron
sold the furniture of her humble lodging with the exception of her
little plate and scanty linen which she took with her and the whole
amount of the sale did not yield SEVENTYFIVE POUNDS
CHAPTER II
Moral Effects of local Scenery a Peculiarity in TasteEarly Love
Impressions and Traditions
Before I proceed to the regular narrative of the character and
adventures of Lord Byron it seems necessary to consider the probable
effects of his residence during his boyhood in Scotland  It is
generally agreed that while a schoolboy in Aberdeen he evinced a
lively spirit and sharpness enough to have equalled any of his
schoolfellows had he given sufficient application  In the few
reminiscences preserved of his childhood it is remarkable that he
appears in this period commonly of innocence and playfulness rarely
to have evinced any symptom of generous feeling  Silent rages moody
sullenness and revenge are the general characteristics of his
conduct as a boy
He was undoubtedly delicately susceptible of impressions from the
beauties of nature for he retained recollections of the scenes which
interested his childish wonder fresh and glowing to his latest
days nor have there been wanting plausible theories to ascribe the
formation of his poetical character to the contemplation of those
romantic scenes  But whoever has attended to the influential causes
of character will reject such theories as shallow and betraying
great ignorance of human nature  Genius of every kind belongs to
some innate temperament it does not necessarily imply a particular
bent because that may possibly be the effect of circumstances  but
without question the peculiar quality is inborn and particular to
the individual  All hear and see much alike but there is an
undefinable though wide difference between the ear of the musician
or the eye of the painter compared with the hearing and seeing
organs of ordinary men and it is in something like that difference
in which genius consists  Genius is however an ingredient of mind
more easily described by its effects than by its qualities  It is as
the fragrance independent of the freshness and complexion of the
rose as the light on the cloud as the bloom on the cheek of beauty
of which the possessor is unconscious until the charm has been seen
by its influence on others it is the internal golden flame of the
opal a something which may be abstracted from the thing in which it
appears without changing the quality of its substance its form or
its affinities  I am not therefore disposed to consider the idle
and reckless childhood of Byron as unfavourable to the development of
his genius but on the contrary inclined to think that the
indulgence of his mother leaving him so much to the accidents of
undisciplined impression was calculated to cherish associations
which rendered them in the maturity of his powers ingredients of
spell that ruled his memory
It is singular and I am not aware it has been before noticed that
with all his tender and impassioned apostrophes to beauty and love
Byron has in no instance not even in the freest passages of Don
Juan associated either the one or the other with sensual images
The extravagance of Shakespeares Juliet when she speaks of Romeo
being cut after his death into stars that all the world may be in
love with night is flame and ecstasy compared to the icy
metaphysical glitter of Byrons amorous allusions  The verses
beginning with
She walks in beauty like the light
Of eastern climes and starry skies
are a perfect example of what I have conceived of his bodiless
admiration of beauty and objectless enthusiasm of love  The
sentiment itself is unquestionably in the highest mood of the
intellectual sense of beauty the simile is however anything but
such an image as the beauty of woman would suggest  It is only the
remembrance of some impression or imagination of the loveliness of a
twilight applied to an object that awakened the same abstract general
idea of beauty  The fancy which could conceive in its passion the
charms of a female to be like the glow of the evening or the general
effect of the midnight stars must have been enamoured of some
beautiful abstraction rather than aught of flesh and blood  Poets
and lovers have compared the complexion of their mistresses to the
hues of the morning or of the evening and their eyes to the dewdrops
and the stars but it has no place in the feelings of man to think of
female charms in the sense of admiration which the beauties of the
morning or the evening awaken  It is to make the simile the
principal  Perhaps however it may be as well to defer the
criticism to which this peculiar characteristic of Byrons amatory
effusions gives rise until we shall come to estimate his general
powers as a poet  There is upon the subject of love no doubt much
beautiful composition throughout his works but not one line in all
the thousands which shows a sexual feeling of female attractionall
is vague and passionless save in the delicious rhythm of the verse
But these remarks though premature as criticisms are not uncalled
for here even while we are speaking of a child not more than ten
years old  Before Byron had attained that age he describes himself
as having felt the passion  Dante is said as early as nine years old
to have fallen in love with Beatrice Alfieri who was himself
precocious in the passion considered such early sensibility to be an
unerring sign of a soul formed for the fine arts and Canova used to
say that he was in love when but five years old  But these
instances however prove nothing  Calflove as it is called in the
country is common and in Italy it may arise earlier than in the
bleak and barren regions of Lochynagar  This movement of juvenile
sentiment is not however lovethat strong masculine avidity
which in its highest excitement is unrestrained by the laws alike
of God and man  In truth the feeling of this kind of love is the
very reverse of the irrepressible passion it is a mean shrinking
stealthy awe and in no one of its symptoms at least in none of
those which Byron describes has it the slightest resemblance to that
bold energy which has prompted men to undertake the most improbable
adventures
He was not quite eight years old when according to his own account
he formed an impassioned attachment to Mary Duff and he gives the
following account of his recollection of her nineteen years
afterwards
I have been thinking lately a good deal of Mary Duff  How very odd
that I should have been so devotedly fond of that girl at an age
when I could neither feel passion nor know the meaning of the word
and the effect  My mother used always to rally me about this
childish amour and at last many years after when I was sixteen
she told me one day O Byron I have had a letter from Edinburgh
and your old sweetheart Mary Duff is married to Mr C  And what
was my answer  I really cannot explain or account for my feelings at
that moment but they nearly threw me into convulsions and alarmed
my mother so much that after I grew better she generally avoided the
subjectto MEand contented herself with telling it to all her
acquaintance  But was this agitation the effect of natural feeling
or of something in the manner in which his mother may have told the
news  He proceeds to inquire  Now what could this be  I had never
seen her since her mothers faux pas at Aberdeen had been the cause
of her removal to her grandmothers at Banff  We were both the
merest children  I had and have been attached fifty times since
that period yet I recollect all we said to each other all our
caresses her features my restlessness sleeplessness my tormenting
my mothers maid to write for me to her which she at last did to
quiet me  Poor Nancy thought I was wild and as I could not write
for myself became my secretary  I remember too our walks and the
happiness of sitting by Mary in the childrens apartment at their
house not far from the Plainstones at Aberdeen while her lesser
sister Helen played with the doll and we sat gravely making love
in our own way
How the deuce did all this occur so early  Where could it
originate  I certainly had no sexual ideas for years afterward and
yet my misery my love for that girl were so violent that I
sometimes doubt if I have ever been really attached since  Be that
as it may hearing of her marriage several years afterward was as a
thunderstroke  It nearly choked me to the horror of my mother and
the astonishment and almost incredulity of everybody and it is a
phenomenon in my existence for I was not eight years old which has
puzzled and will puzzle me to the latest hour of it  And lately I
know not why the RECOLLECTION NOT the attachment has recurred as
forcibly as ever  I wonder if she can have the least remembrance of
it or me or remember pitying her sister Helen for not having an
admirer too  How very pretty is the perfect image of her in my
memory  Her dark brown hair and hazel eyes her very dressI should
be quite grieved to see her now  The reality however beautiful
would destroy or at least confuse the features of the lovely Peri
which then existed in her and still lives in my imagination at the
distance of more than sixteen years
Such precocious and sympathetic affections are as I have already
mentioned common among children and is something very different
from the love of riper years but the extract is curious and shows
how truly little and vague Byrons experience of the passion must
have been  In his recollection of the girl be it observed there is
no circumstance noticed which shows however strong the mutual
sympathy the slightest influence of particular attraction  He
recollects the colour of her hair the hue of her eyes her very
dress and he remembers her as a Peri a spirit nor does it appear
that his sleepless restlessness in which the thought of her was ever
uppermost was produced by jealousy or doubt or fear or any other
concomitant of the passion
There is another most important circumstance in what may be called
the Aberdonian epoch of Lord Byrons life
That Byron in his boyhood was possessed of lively sensibilities is
sufficiently clear that he enjoyed the advantage of indulging his
humour and temper without restraint is not disputable and that his
natural temperament made him sensible in no ordinary degree to the
beauties of nature is also abundantly manifest in all his
productions but it is surprising that this admiration of the
beauties of Nature is but an ingredient in Byrons poetry and not
its most remarkable characteristic  Deep feelings of dissatisfaction
and disappointment are far more obvious they constitute indeed the
very spirit of his works and a spirit of such qualities is the least
of all likely to have arisen from the contemplation of magnificent
Nature or to have been inspired by studying her storms or serenity
for dissatisfaction and disappointment are the offspring of moral
experience and have no natural association with the forms of
external things  The habit of associating morose sentiments with any
particular kind of scenery only shows that the sources of the
sullenness arose in similar visible circumstances  It is from these
premises I would infer that the seeds of Byrons misanthropic
tendencies were implanted during the silent rages of his childhood
and that the effect of mountain scenery which continued so strong
upon him after he left Scotland producing the sentiments with which
he has imbued his heroes in the wild circumstances in which he places
them was mere reminiscence and association  For although the sullen
tone of his mind was not fully brought out until he wrote Childe
Harold it is yet evident from his Hours of Idleness that he was
tuned to that key before he went abroad  The dark colouring of his
mind was plainly imbibed in a mountainous region from sombre heaths
and in the midst of rudeness and grandeur  He had no taste for more
cheerful images and there are neither rural objects nor villagery in
the scenes he describes but only loneness and the solemnity of
mountains
To those who are acquainted with the Scottish character it is
unnecessary to suggest how very probable it is that Mrs Byron and her
associates were addicted to the oral legends of the district and of
her ancestors and that the early fancy of the poet was nourished
with the shadowy descriptions in the tales o the olden timeat
last this is manifest that although Byron shows little of the
melancholy and mourning of Ossian he was yet evidently influenced by
some strong bias and congeniality of taste to brood and cogitate on
topics of the same character as those of that bard  Moreover
besides the probability of his imagination having been early tinged
with the sullen hue of the local traditions it is remarkable that
the longest of his juvenile poems is an imitation of the manner of
the Homer of Morven
In addition to a natural temperament kept in a state of continual
excitement by unhappy domestic incidents and the lurid legends of
the past there were other causes in operation around the young poet
that could not but greatly affect the formation of his character
Descended of a distinguished family counting among its ancestors the
fated line of the Scottish kings and reduced almost to extreme
poverty it is highly probable both from the violence of her temper
and the pride of blood that Mrs Byron would complain of the almost
mendicant condition to which she was reduced especially so long as
there was reason to fear that her son was not likely to succeed to
the family estates and dignity  Of his fathers lineage few
traditions were perhaps preserved compared with those of his
mothers family but still enough was known to impress the
imagination  Mr Moore struck with this circumstance has remarked
that in reviewing the ancestors both near and remote of Lord
Byron it cannot fail to be remarked how strikingly he combined in
his own nature some of the best and perhaps worst qualities that lie
scattered through the various characters of his predecessors  But
still it is to his mothers traditions of her ancestors that I would
ascribe the conception of the dark and guilty beings which he
delighted to describe  And though it may be contended that there was
little in her conduct to exalt poetical sentiment still there was a
