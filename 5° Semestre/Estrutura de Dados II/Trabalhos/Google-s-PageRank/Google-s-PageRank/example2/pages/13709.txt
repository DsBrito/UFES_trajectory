splendid conservatory than Shoemakers wrote played and consecrated
to you his famous Lone Star March wherewith he so disquieted the
public present of the next concert in the White House grounds  Or I
might hark back to the campaign of 92 when together we struggled
against national politics as evinced in the city of New York I might
repaint that election night when with one hundred thousand whirling
dervishes of democracy in Madison Square dancing dances and singing
songs of victory we undertook through the hubbub to send from the
Twentythird street telegraph office halfhourly bulletins to our
papers in the West how you accompanied of the dignified Richard
Bright went often to the Fifth Avenue Hotel and how at last you
dictated your bulletinsa sort of triumphant blank verse they
wereas Homeric of spirit as lofty of phraseto me who caught them
as they came from your lips losing none of their fire and so
flashed them all burning into Texas far away  But of what avail
would be such recount  Distance separates us and time has come
between  Those are the old years these are the new with newer
years beyond  Life like a sea is filling from rivers of experience
Forgetfulness rises as a tide and creeps upward to drown within us
those stories of the days that were  And because this is true it
comes to me that you as a memory must stand tallest in the midst of
my regard  For of you I find within me no forgetfulness  I have met
others they came they tarried they departed  They came again and
on this second encounter the recollection of their existences smote
upon me as a surprise  I had forgotten them as though they had not
been  But such is not your tale  Drawn on the plates of memory as
with a tool of diamond I carry you both in broadest outline and in
each least of shade and there hangs no picture in the gallery of
hours gone to which I turn with more of pleasure and of good  Nor
am I alone in my recollection  Do I pass through the Fifth Avenue
Hotel on my way to the Hoffman that vandyked dispenser leans
pleasantly across his counter to ask with deepest interest Do you
hear from the Old Man now  Or am I belated in Shanleys a beaming
ring of waitersif it be not an hour overrun of customwill
halfcircle my table and the boldest Pat will question timidly
yet with a kindly Galway warmth Hows the Old Man  Old Man  That
is your title at once dignified and affectionate and by it you come
often to be referred to along Broadway these ten years after its
conference  And when the latest word is uttered what is there more
to fame  I shall hold myself fortunate indeed if departing Im
remembered by half so many half so long  But wherefore extend
ourselves regretfully  We may meet again the game is not played
out  Pending such bright chance I dedicate this book to you  It is
the most of honour that lies in my lean power  And in so doing I am
almost moved to say as said Goldsmith of Johnson in his offering of
She Stoops to Conquer By inscribing this slight performance to
you I do not mean to so much compliment you as myself  It may do me
some honour to inform the public that I have lived many years in
intimacy with you  It may serve the interests of mankind also to
inform them that the greatest wit may be found in a character without
impairing the most unaffected piety  I repeat I am all but moved
to write these lines of you  It would tell my case at least and
while description might limp in so far as you lack somewhat of that
snuffle of true piety so often engaging the Johnsonian nose you
make up the defect with possession of a wider philosophy a better
humour and a brighter quicker wit than visited or dwelt beneath the
candlescorched wig of our old bully lexicographer
ALFRED HENRY LEWIS
Some Cowboy Facts
There are certain truths of a botanical character that are not
generally known  Each year the trees in their occupation creep
further west  There are regions in Missourinot bottom landswhich
sixty years ago were bald and bare of trees  Today they are heavy
with timber  Westward beyond the trees lie the prairies and
beyond the prairies the plains the first are green with long
grasses the latter bare brown and with a crisp scorched sparse
vesture of vegetation scarce worth the name  As the trees march
slowly westward in conquest of the prairies so also do the prairies
in their verdant turn become aggressors and push westward upon the
plains  These last stretches extending to the base of that bluff
and sudden bulwark the Rocky Mountains can go no further  The
Rockies hold the plains at bay and break as it were the teeth of
the desert  As a result of this warfare of vegetations the plains
are to first disappear in favour of the prairies and the prairies to
give way before the trees  These mutations all wait on rain and as
the rain belt goes ever and ever westward a strip of plains each
year surrenders its aridity and the prairies and then the trees
press on and take new ground
These facts should contain some virtue of interest the more since
with the changes chronicled come also changes in the character of
both the inhabitants and the employments of these regions  With a
civilised people extending themselves over new lands cattle form
ever the advance guard  Then come the farms  This is the procession
of a civilised peaceful invasion thus is the column marshalled
First the pastoral next the agricultural third and last the
manufacturingand per consequence the big cities where the
treasure chests of a race are kept  Blood and bone and muscle and
heart are to the front and the money that steadies and stays and
protects and repays them and their efforts to the rear
Forty years ago about all that took place west of the Mississipi of a
moneymaking character was born of cattle  The cattle were worked in
huge herds and like the buffalo supplanted by them roamed in
unnumbered thousands  In a prerailroad period cattle were killed
for their hides and tallow and smart Yankee coasters went constantly
to such ports as Galveston for these cargoes   The beef was left to
the coyotes
Cattle find a natural theatre of existence on the plains  There
likewise flourishes the pastoral man  But cattle herding confined
to the plains gives way before the westward creep of agriculture
Each year beholds more western acres broken by the plough each year
witnesses a diminution of the cattle ranges and cattle herding  This
need ring no bell of alarm concerning a future barren of a beef
supply  More cattle are the product of the farmregions than of the
ranges  That ground once range and now farm raises more cattle now
than then  Texas is a great cattle State  Ohio Indiana Illinois
Iowa and Missouri are first States of agriculture  The area of
Texas is about even with the collected area of the other five  Yet
one finds double the number of cattle in Ohio Indiana Illinois
Iowa and Missouri than in Texas to say nothing of tenfold the sheep
and hogs  No one may be calm one is not to fall a prey to any
hunger of beef
While the farms in their westward pushing do not diminish the cattle
they reduce the cattleman and pinch off much that is romantic and
picturesque  Between the farm and the wire fence the cowboy as
once he flourished has been modified subdued and made partially to
disappear  In the good old days of the Jones and Plummer trail there
were no wire fences and the sullen farmer had not yet arrived  Your
cowboy at that time was a person of thrill and consequence  He wore
a broadbrimmed Stetson hat and all about it a rattlesnake skin by
way of band retaining head and rattles  This was to be potent
against headachesa malady by the way which swept down no cowboy
save in hours emergent of a spree  In such case the snake cure
didnt cure  The hat was retained in defiance of winds by a
leathern cord caught about the back of the head not under the chin
This cord was beautiful with a garniture of three or four perforated
poker chips red yellow and blue
There are sundry angles of costume where the dandyism of a cowboy of
spirit and conceit may acquit itself these are hatband spurs
saddle and leggins  Ive seen hatbands made of braided gold and
silver filigree they were from Santa Fe and always in the form of a
rattlesnake with rubies or emeralds or diamonds for eyes  Such
gauds would cost from four hundred to two thousand dollars  Also
Ive encountered a saddle which depleted its proud owner a round
twentyfive hundred dollars  It was of finest Spanish leather
stamped and spattered with gold bosses  There was goldcapping on
the saddle horn and again on the circle of the cantle  It was a
dream of a saddle made at Paso del Norte and the owner had it
cinched upon a bronco dear at twenty dollars  One couldnt have sold
the pony for a stack of white chips in any faro game of that
neighbourhood Las Vegas and they were all crooked games at that
Your cowboy dandy frequently wears wrought steel spurs inlaid with
silver and gold price anything you please  If he flourish a true
Brummel of the plains his leggins will be fronted from instep to belt
with the thick pelt hair outside of a Newfoundland dog  These
chapps are meant to protect the cowboy from rain and cold as well
as plum bushes wire fences and other obstacles inimical and against
which he may lunge while riding headlong in the dark  The hair of
the Newfoundland thick and long and laid the right way defies the
rains and your cowboy loathes water
Save in those four cardinals of vanity enumerated your cowboy wears
nothing from weakness the rest of his outfit is legitimate  The
long sharp heels of his boots are there to dig into the ground and
hold fast to his mother earth while roping on foot  His gay pony
when roped of a frosty morning would skate him all across and about
the plains if it were not for these heels  The buckskin gloves tied
in one of the saddle strings are used when roping and to keep the
halfinch manila lariator mayhap its horsehair or rawhide
pleatedfrom burning his hands  The red silken sash one was wont
aforetime to see knotted about his waist was used to hogtie and hold
down the big cattle when roped and thrown  The sashstrong soft
and closecould be tied more tightly quickly surely than anything
besides  In these days with wire pastures and branding pens and the
fine certainty of modern roundups and a consequent paucity of
mavericks big cattle are seldom roped wherefor the sash has been
much cast aside
The saddlebags or warbagsalso covered of dogskin to match the
leggins and worn behind not forward of the riderare the cowboys
official wardrobe wherein he carries his second suit of underclothes
and his other shirt  His handkerchief red cotton is loosely
knotted about the cowboys neck knot to the rear  He wipes the
sweat from his brow therewith on those hot Texas days when in a
branding pen he flanks calves or feeds the fires or handles the
irons or stands off the horned indignation of the cows resentful
because of burned and bawling offspring
It would take two hundred thousand words to tell in half fashion the
story of the cowboy  His religion of fatalism his courage his
rides at full swing in midnight darkness to head and turn and hold a
herd stampeded when a slip on the stormsoaked grass by his unshod
pony or a misplaced prairiedog hole means a tumble and a tumble
means that a hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of cattle with
hoofs like chopping knives will run over him and make him look and
feel and become as dead as a cancelled postage stamp his troubles
his joys his soberness in camp his drunkenness in town and his
feuds and occasional gun plays are not to be disposed of in a
preface  One cannot in such cramped space so much as hit the high
places in a cowboy career
At work on the range and about his campfor bar accidents wherever
you find a cowboy you will find a campthe cowboy is a youth of
sober quiet dignity  There is a deal of deep politeness and nothing
of epithet insult or horseplay where everybody wears a gun
There are no folk inquisitive on the ranges  No one asks your name
If driven by stress of conversation to something akin to it the
cowboy will say What may I call you sir  And hes as careful to
add the sir as he is to expect it in return
You are at liberty to select what name you prefer  Where you hail
from where going why are queries never put  To look at the brand
on your ponyyou a strangeris a dangerous vulgarity to which no
gentleman of the Panhandle or any other region of pure southwestern
politeness would stoop  And if you wish to arouse an instant
combination of hate suspicion and contempt in the bosom of a cowboy
you have but to stretch forth your artless Eastern hand and ask Let
me look at your gun
Cowboys on the range or in the town are excessively clannish  They
never desert each other but stay and fight and die and storm a jail
and shoot a sheriff if needs press to rescue a comrade made captive
in their company  Also they care for each other when sick or
injured and set one anothers bones when broken in the falls and
tumbles of their craft  On the range the cowboy is quiet just and
peaceable  There are neither women nor cards nor rum about the cow
camps  The ranches and the boys themselves banish the two latter
and the first wont come  Women cards and whiskey the three war
causes of the West are confined to the towns
Those occasions when cattle are shipped and the beefherds per
consequence driven to the shipping point become the only times when
the cowboy sees the town  In such hours he blooms and lives fully up
to his opportunity  He has travelled perhaps two hundred miles and
has been twenty days on the trail for cattle may only be driven
about ten miles a day he has been up day and night and slept half
the time in the saddle he has made himself hoarse singing Sam Bass
and The Dying Ranger to keep the cattle quiet and stave off
stampedes he has ridden ten ponies to shadows in his twenty days of
driving wherefore and naturally your cowboy feels like relaxing
There would be as many as ten men with each beefherd and the herd
would include about five thousand head  There would be six riders
divided into three watches to stand night guard over the herd and
drive it through the day there would be two hoss hustlers to hold
the eighty or ninety ponies turn and turn about and carry them
along with the herd there would be the cook with four mules and the
chuck wagon and lastly there would be the herdboss a cow expert
he and at the head of the business
Once the herd is off his hands and his mind at the end of the drive
the cowboy unbuckles and reposes himself from his labours  He
becomes deeply and famously drunk  Hungering for the excitement of
play he collides amiably with faro and monte and what other deadfalls
are rife of the place  Never does he win for the games arent
arranged that way  But he enjoys himself and his losses do not prey
on him
Sated with faro bank and montethey cant be called games of chance
the only games of chance occurring when cowboys engage with each
other at billiards or poolsated I say with faro and Mexican
monte and exuberant of rum which last has regular quick renewal
our cowboy will stagger to his pony swing into the saddle and with
gladsome whoops and an occasional outburst from his six shooter
directed toward the heavens charge up and down the street  This
last amusement appeals mightily to cowboys too drunk to walk  For
be it known a gentleman may ride long after he may not walk
If a theatre be in action and mayhap a troop of Red Stocking
Blondes elevating the drama therein the cowboy is sure to attend
Also he will arrive with his lariat wound about his body under his
coat and his place will be the front row  At some engaging crisis
such as the March of the Amazons having first privily unwound and
organised his lariat to that end he will arise and rope an Amazon
This will produce bad language from the manager of the show and
compel the lady to sit upon the stage to the detriment of her
wardrobe if no worse and all to keep from being pulled across the
footlights  Yet the exercise gives the cowboy deepest pleasure
Having thus distinguished the lady of his admiration later he will
meet her and escort her to the local dancehall  There mingling with
their frank companions the two will drink and loosen the boards of
the floor with the strenuous dances of our frontier till daylight
does appear
For the matter of a week or perchance twoit depends on how fast
his money meltsin these fashions will our gentleman of cows engage
his hours and expand himself  He will make a deal of noise drink a
deal of whiskey acquire a deal of what he terms action but he
harms nobody and in a town toughened to his racket and which needs
and gets his money disturbs nobody
Let him whoop it up hes paying for it aint he will be the
prompt local retort to any inquiry as to why he is thus permitted to
disport
So long as the cowboy observes the etiquette of the town he will not
be molested or called down by marshal or sheriff or citizen  There
are four things your cowboy must not do  He must not insult a woman
he must not shoot his pistol in a store or barroom he must not ride
his pony into those places of resort and as a last proposal he must
not ride his pony on the sidewalks  Shooting or riding into
barrooms is reckoned as dangerous riding on the sidewalk comes more
under the head of insult and is popularly regarded as a taunting
defiance of the town marshal  On such occasions the marshal never
fails to respond and the cowboy is called upon to surrender  If he
complies which to the credit of his horsesense he commonly does he
is led into brief captivity to be made loose when cooled  Does he
resist arrest there is an explosive rattle of six shooters a mad
scattering of the careful citizenry out of lines of fire and a
cowboy or marshal is added to the host beyond  At the close of the
festival if the marshal still lives he is congratulated if the
cowboy survives he is lynched if both fall they are buried with the
honours of frontier war while whatever the event the communal
ripple is but slight and only of the moment following which the
currents of Western existence sweep easily and calmly onward as
before

WOLFVILLE NIGHTS
CHAPTER I
The Dismissal of Silver Phil
His name complete is Silver City Philip  In them social
observances of the Southwest wherein haste is a feacher an brevty the
bulls eye aimed at said cognomen gets shortened to Silver Phil
The Old Cattleman looked thoughtfully into his glass as if by that
method he collected the scattered elements of a story  There was a
pause then he lifted the glass to his lips as one who being now evenly
equipped of information proposed that it arrive hand in hand with the
inspiration which should build a tale from it
Shore this Silver Phil is dead now an I never yet crosses up with
the gent whos that sooperfluous as to express regrets  Its Dan Boggs
who dismisses Silver Phil Dan does it in efforts he puts forth to
faithfully represent the right
Doc Peets allers allows this Silver Phil is a degenrate leastwise
thats the word Peets uses  An while I freely concedes I aint none
too clar as to jest what a degenrate is I stands ready to back
Peets deescription to win  Peets is bar Colonel William Greene
Sterett the best eddicated sharp in Arizona also the wariest as to
expressin views  Tharfore when Peets puts it up onflinchin that
this yere Silver Phils a degenrate youall can spread your blankets
an go to sleep on it that a degenrate he is
Silver Phil is a little dark ignorant tousledhared party none
too neat in costume  Hes as black an small an evilseemin as a
Mexican still you sees at a glance he aint no Greaser neither  An
with all this yere surface wickedness Silver Phil has a quick
hystercal way like a woman or a bird an thats ever a grin on his
face  You can smell bad off Silver Phil like smoke in a house an
folks whos on the levelan most folks isconceives a notion agin
him the moment him an they meets up
The first time I observes Silver Phil hes walkin down the licker
room of the Red Light  As he goes by the bar Black Jackwhos
rearrangin the nosepaint on the shelf so it shows to advantagegets
careless an drops a bottle
Crash it goes onto the floor
With the sound an the onexpected suddenness of it stampedin his
nerves that away Silver Phil leaps into the air like a cat an when
he lights hes frontin Black Jack an a gun in each hand
Which I wont be took says Silver Phil all flustered
His eyes is gleamin an his face is palin an his ugly grin gets
even uglier than before  But like a flash he sees thars nothin to
go in the air aboutnothin that means him an he puts up his
hardware an composes himsef
Youall conducts yoursef like a sport who has something on his
mind says Texas Thompson whos thar present at the time an cant
refrain from commentin on the start that bottlesmashin gives Silver
Phil
This Silver Phil makes no response but sort o grins plenty ghastly
while his breath comes quick
Still while youall notes easy that this persons scared its plain
hes a killer jest the same  Its frequent that away  Im never much
afraid of one of your cold game gents like Cherokee Hall you can
gamble the limit theyll never put a sixshooter in play till its
shorely come their turn  But timid feverish locoed people whose
jedgment is bad an whos prone to feel themsefs in peril theyre the
kind who kills  For mysef I shuns all sech  I wont say them
erratic quicktokill sports dont have courage only it strikes
mean Ive rode up on a heap of emits more like a fearbit
frocity than sand
Take Enright or Peets or Cherokee or Tutt or Jack Moore or Boggs or
Texas Thompson youre plumb safe with sech gentsall or any  An yet
thar aint the first glimmer of bein gunshy about one of em theyre
as clean strain as the eternal granite an no more likely to hide out
from danger than a hill  An while they differs from each other yet
theyre all different from sech folks as Silver Phil  Boggs goin to
war is full of goodhumoured grandeur gala and confident ready to
start or stop like a good hoss  Cherokee Hall is quiet an wordless
he gets pale but sharp an deadly an his notion is to fight for a
finish  Peets is haughty an sooperior on the few ocasions when he
onbends in battle an comports himsef like a gent who fights
downhill the same ondoubted bein doo to them book advantages of
Peets which elevates him an lifts him above the common herd a whole
lot  Enright whos oldest is of course slowest to embark in blood an
pulls his weeponswhen he does pull emwith sorrowful resignation
Which Im shorely saddest when I shoots says Enright to me as he
reloads his gun one time
These yere humane sentiments however dont deter him from shootin
soon an aimin low which latter habits makes Wolfvilles honoured
chief a highly desprate game to get aginst
Jack Moore bein as I explains former the execyootive of the
Stranglers an responsible for law an order has a heap of shootin
shoved onto him from time to time  Jack allers transacts these
fireworks with a cam offishul front the same bein devoid equal of
anger or regrets  Tutt particlar after he weds Tucson Jennie an
more particlar still when he reaps new honours as the originator of
that blessed infant Enright Peets Tutt carries on what shootin comes
his way in a manner a lot dignified an lofty while Texas
Thompsonwhos mebby morbid about his wife down in Laredo demandin
she be divorced that timealthough he picks up his hand in a fracas
ready an irritable an with no delays after all is that wellbalanced
hes bound to be each time plumb right
Which you observes son from these yere settins forth that thars
a mighty sight of difference between gents like them pards of mine an
degenrates of the tribe of Silver Phil  Its the difference between
right an wrong one works from a impulse of pure jestice the other is
moved of a sperit of crime an thar you be
Silver Phil we learns lateran it shore jestifies Peets in his
theories about him bein a degenratehas been in plenty of blood
But allers like a cat savage gorethirsty yet shy prideless an
ready to fly  It seems he begins to be homicidal in a humble way by
downin a trooper over near Fort Cummings  Thats four years before he
visits us  Hes been blazin away intermittent ever since and allers
crooel crafty an safe  Its got to be a shore thing or Silver Phil
quits an goes into the water like a mink
This yere ondersized miscreant aint hanted about Wolfville moren
four days before he shows how onnecessary he is to our success  Which
he works a har copper on Cherokee Hall  Whats a har copper  Ill
onfold short and terse what Silver Phil does an then you saveys
Cherokees dealin his gamefarobank she is an if all them national
banks conducts themsefs as squar as that enterprise of Cherokees
the fields of finance would be as safely honest as a church
Cherokees turnin his game one evenin Faro Nell on the lookout stool
where she belongs  Silver Phil drifts up to the layout an camps
over back of the kingend  He gets chips an goes to takin chances
alternate on the king queen jack ten all side an side they be
Cherokee bein squar himsef aint overprone to expect a devious play
in others  He dont notice this Silver Phil none speshul an shoves
the kyards
Silver Phil wins three or four bets its Nell that catches on to his
racket an signs up to Cherokee onder the table with her little foot
One glance an Cherokee is loaded with information  This Silver Phil
it seems in a sperit of avarice equips himsef with a copperlittle
wooden checker is what this copper isone hes done filched from
Cherokee the day prior  Hes fastened a long black hosshar to it
an he ties the other end of the hosshar to his belt in front  This
har is long enough as hes planted at the table that away so it
reaches nice to them four nearest kyardsthe king queen jack ten
An said har is plumb invisible except to eyes as sharp as Faro
Nells  The deceitful Silver Phil will have a stack on one of em
coppered with this yere har copper  He watches the box  As the turns
is made if the kyards come his way well an good  Silver Phil does
nothin but garners in results  When the kyards start to show agin
him however thats different  In sech events Silver Phil draws in
his breath sort o takin in on the hosshar an the copper comes
off the bet  When the turn is made thars Silver Phils betby
virchoo of said fraudopen an triumphant an waitin to be paid
Cherokee gets posted quick an with a look  As sharp as winkin
Cherokee has a nineinch bowie in his hand an with one slash cuts the
hosshar clost up by Silver Phils belt
Thats a yoonique invention observes Cherokee an hes sarcastic
while he menaces with the knife at Silver Phil that contraption is
shorely plenty sagacious  But it dont go here  Shove in your chips
Silver Phil obeys an he shows furtive ugly an alarmed an all of
em at once  He dont say a word  Now pull your freight concloods
Cherokee  If you ever drifts within ten foot of a game of mine agin
Ill throw this knife plumb through youthrough an through  An
Cherokee by way of lustration lets fly the knife across the barroom
It comes like a flash
Chuck
Thars a picture paper pasted onto the wooden wall of the Red Light
displayin the liniaments of some party  That bowie pierces the
picturea shot in the cross it isan all with sech fervour that the
pint of the blade shows a inch an a half on the other side of that
individyool board
The next time I throws a knife in your presence remarks Cherokee to
Silver Phil an Cherokees as cold an pisonous as a rattlesnake
itll be lanched at you
Silver Phil dont say nothin in retort  Hes aware by the libral
way Cherokee seprates himsef from the bowie that said weepon cant
constitoote Cherokees entire armament  An as Silver Phil dont pack
the sperit to face no sech flashlight warrior he acts on Cherokees
hint to vamos an fades into the street  Shore Cherokee dont cash
the felons chips none he confiscates em  Cherokee aint quite so
tenderly romantic as to make good to a detected robber  Moreover he
lets this Silver Phil go onharmed when by every roole his skelp is
forfeit  It turns out good for the camp however as this yere
experience proves so depressin to Silver Phil he removes his blankets
to Red Dog  Thar among them purblind tarrapins its inhabitants its
likely he gets prosperous an ondetected action on that little old har
copper of his
Its not only my beliefs but likewise the opinions of sech joodicial
sports as Enright Peets an Colonel Sterett that this maverick
Silver Phil is all sorts of a crimnal  An I wouldnt wonder if hes
a pure rustler that away as ready to stand up a stage as snake a play
at farobank  This idee settles down on the Wolfville intellgence on
the heels of a vicissitoode wherein Dan Boggs performs an which gets
pulled off over in the Bird Cage Opry House  Jack Moore aint thar
none that time  Usual Jack is a constant deevotee of the dramy
Jacks not only a firstnighter he comes mighty clost to bein a
everynighter  But this particlar evenin when Boggs performs Jacks
rummagin about someers else
If Jacks thar its even money hed ahad that second shot instead of
Boggs in which event the results might have been something graver
than this yere minoote wound which Boggs confers  Im confident Jack
would have cut in with the second shot for sech is his offishul system
Jack moren once proclaims his position
By every roole of law says Jack at epocks when he declars himsef
an on all ocasions I as kettletender to the Stranglers is
entitled to the first shot  When I uses the term ocasion I would
be onderstood as alloodin to affairs of a simply social kind an not
to robberies holdups hosslarcenies an other an simlar
transactions in speclatif crime when every gent defends his own
Speakin social however I reasserts that by every roole of guidance
Im entitled to the first shot  Which a doo regyard for these plain
rights of mine would go far to freein Wolfville upper circles of the
bullets which occurs from time to time an which even the most
onconventional admits is shore a drawback  All I can add as a
closer concloods Jack is that Ill make haste to open on any sport
who transgresses these fiats an goes to shootin first  Moreover
its likely that said offender finds that when Im started once what I
misses in the orignal deal Ill make up in the draw an I tharfore
trusts that none will prove so sooicidal as to put me to the test
This Bird Cage Opry House evenin however Jack is absent a heap
Dan Boggs is present an is leanin back appreciatin the show an the
Valley Tan plenty impartial  Dan likes both an is doin em even
jestice  Over oppsite to Dan is a drunken passel of sports from Red
Dog said wretched hamlet bein behind Wolfville in that as in all
