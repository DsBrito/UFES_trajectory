THE
MYSTERY OF MR E DROOD
AN ADAPTATION
BY ORPHEUS C KERR
CHAPTER XIIContinued
The pauper burialground toward which they now progress in a rather
highstepping manner orto vary the phrasetoward which their steps
are now very much bent is not a favorite resort of the more cheerful
village people after nightfall Ask any resident of Bumsteadville if he
believed in ghosts and if the time were midday and the place a
crowded grocery store he would fearlessly answer in the negative just
the same as a Positive philosopher in castiron health and with no
thunder shower approaching would undauntedly deny a Deity but if any
resident of Bumsteadville should happen to be caught near the country
editors last home after dark he would get over that part of his road
in a curiously agile and flighty mannerjust the same as a Positive
philosopher with a sore throat or at an uncommonly showy bit of
lightning would repeat Now I lay me down to sleep with surprising
devotion So although no one in all Bumsteadville was in the least
afraid of the pauper burialground at any hour it was not invariably
selected by the great mass of the populace as a peerless place to go
home by at midnight and the two intellectual explorers find no
sentimental young couples rambling arm in arm among the ghastly
headboards nor so much as one loiterer smoking his segar on a
suicides tomb
JOHN McLAUGHLIN youre getting nervous again says Mr BUMSTEAD
catching him in the coat collar with the handle of his umbrella and
drawing the other toward him handoverhand Its about time that you
should revert again to the hoary JAMES AKERS excellent preparation for
the human familyIll try it first myself to see if it tastes at all
of the cork
Ahh sighs OLD MORTARITY after his turn has come and been enjoyed at
last thats the kind of Spirits I dont mind being a wrapper to I
could wrap them up all right
Reflectively chewing a clove the Ritualistic organist reclines on the
pauper grave of a former writer for the daily press and cogitates upon
his companions leaning to Spiritualism while the other produces
matches and lights their lanterns
Mr McLAUGHLIN he solemnly remarks waving his umbrella at the graves
around in this scene you behold the very last of mans individual
being In this entombment he ends forever Tremble J McLAUGHLIN
forever Soul and Spirit are but unmeaning words according
to the latest big things in science The departed Dr DAVIS SLAVONSKI
of St Petersburg before setting out for the Asylum proved by his
Atomic Theory that men are neatly manufactured of Atoms of matter
which are continually combining together until they form Man and then
going through the process of Life which is but the mechanical effect of
their combination and then wearing apart again by attrition into the
exhaustion of cohesion called Death and then crumbling into separate
Atoms of native matter or dust again and then gradually combining
again as before and evolving another Man and Living and Dying
again and so on forever Thus and thus only is Man immortal You are
made exclusively of Atoms of matter yourself JOHN McLAUGHLIN So am I
I can understand a mans believing that he himself is all Atoms of
matter and nothing else responds OLD MORTARITY skeptically
As how JOHN McLAUGHLINas how
When he knows that at any rate he hasnt got one atom of common
sense is the answer
Suddenly Mr BUMSTEAD arises from the grave and frantically shakes hands
with him
Youre right sir he says emotionally Youre a gooroleman sir
The Atom of common sense was one of the Atoms that SLAVONSKI forgot all
about Lets do some skeletons now
At the further end of the pauper burialground and in the rear of the
former AlmsHouse once stood a building used successively as a
cidermill a barn and a kind of chapel for paupers Long ago from
neglect and bad weather the frail wooden superstructure had fallen into
pieces and been gradually carted off but a sturdy stone foundation
remained underground and although the flooring over it had for many
years been covered with debris and rank growth so as to be
undistinguishable to common eyes from the general earth around it the
great cellar still extended beneath and according to weird rumor had
some secret access for OLD MORTARITY who used it as a charnel
storehouse for such spoils of the grave as he found in his prowlings
To the spot thus historied the two moralists of the moonlight come now
and with many tumbles Mr McLAUGHLIN removes certain artfully placed
stones and rubbish and lifts a clumsy extemporized trapdoor Below
appears a ricketty old stepladder leading into darkness
I heard such cries and groans down there last Christmas Eve as
sounded worse than the Latin singing in the Ritualistic church
observes McLAUGHLIN
Cries and groans echoes Mr BUMSTEAD turning quite pale and
momentarily forgetting the snakes which he is just beginning to discover
among the stones Youre getting nervous again poor wreck and need
some more West Indian coughmixtureWait until I see for myself
whether its got enough sugar in it
In due time the great nervous antidote is passed and replaced and then
with the lighted lanterns worked around under their arms they go down
the tottering ladder Down they go into a great damp musty cavern to
which their lights give a pallid illumination
See here says OLD MORTARITY raising a long curved bone from the
floor Look at that shoulderblade of unmarried Episcopal lady aged
thirtynine
How do you know she was so old and unmarried asks the organist
Because the shoulderblades so sharp
Mr Bumstead is surprised at this specimen of the art of an AGASSIZ and
WATERHOUSE HAWKINS in such a mortary old man and his intellectual pride
causes him to resolve at once upon a rival display
Look at this skull JOHN McLAUGHLIN he says referring to an object
that he has found behind the ladder See thish fine retreating brow
bulging chin projecting occipital bone and these orifices of ears that
mushtve been stupensly long Its the skull JOHN McLAUGHLIN of a
twinbrother of the man who really wishedreally wished JOHN
McLAUGHLINthat he could be satshfied sir in his own mind that
CHARLES DICKENS was a Christian writer
Why thashs skull of a hog explains Mr McLAUGHLIN with some
contempt
Twinbrotherall thshame says Mr BUMSTEAD as though that made no
earthly difference
Once more what a strange expedition is this How strangely the eyes of
the two men look after two or three more applications to the antique
flask and how curiously Mr Bumstead walks on tiptoe at times and
takes short leaps now and then
Lesh go now says BUMSTEAD after both have been asleep upon their feet
several times I think ths snakes down here JOHN McBUMSTEAD
Whst monkies you meandozens of black monkies Mr BUMPLIN
whispers OLD MORTARITY clutching his arm as he sinks against him
Noshir Serpnts insists Mr BUMSTEAD making futile attempts to open
his umbrella with one hand Warzesmarrer with th lightanshr me t
once Mac JOHNBUNKLIN
In their swayings under the confusions and delusions of the vault their
lanterns have worked around to the neighborhoods of their spines so
that whichever way they turn the light is all behind them Greatly
agitated as men are apt to be when surrounded by supernatural
influences they do not perceive the cause of this apparently unnatural
illumination and upon turning round and round in irregular circles
and still finding the light in the wrong place they exhibit signs of
great trepidation
Warzemarrer wirra light repeats Mr BUMSTEAD spinning wildly until
he brings up against the wall
Ishgotbwitched I blieve pants Mr McLAUGHLIN whirling as
frenziedly with his own lantern dangling behind him and coming to an
abrupt pause against the opposite wall
Thus each supported against the stones by a shoulder they breathe hard
for a moment and then sink into a slumber in which they both slide down
to the ground Aroused by the shock they sit up quite dazed brush away
the swarming snakes and monkies are freshly alarmed by discovering that
they are now actually sitting upon that perverse light behind them and
by a simultaneous impulse begin crawling about in search of the ladder
Unable to see anything with all the light behind him but fancying
that he discerns a gleam beyond a dark object near at hand Mr BUMSTEAD
rises to a standing attitude by a series of complex manoeuvres and
plants a foot on something
Imorthlarrer he cries spiritedly
Thlarrers on me answers Mr MCLAUGHLIN in evidently great
bewilderment
Then ensue a momentary wild struggle and muffled crash for each
gentleman coming blindly upon the other has taken the light glimmering
at the others back for the light at the top of the ladder and further
mistaking the other in the dark for the ladder itself has attempted to
climb him Mr BUMSTEAD however has got the first step whereupon Mr
MCLAUGHLIN in resenting what he takes for the ladders inexcusable
familiarity has twisted both himself and his equally deluded companion
into a pretty hard fall
Another interval of hard breathing and then the organist of Saint Cows
asks Diyou hear anything drop
Yshir thlarrer got throwed frimpudence to a genlmn is the
peevish return of OLD MORTARITY who immediately falls asleep as he
lies with his lantern under his spine
In his sleep he dreams that BUMSTEAD examines him closely with a view
to gaining some clue to the mystery of the light behind both their
backs and on finding the lantern under him and studying it
profoundly for some time is suddenly moved to feel along his own back
He dreams that BUMSTEAD thereupon finds his own lantern and exclaims
after half an hours analytical reflection It mushtave slid round
while JOHN MCLAUGHLIN was intoshcated Then or soon after the
dreamer awakes and can discern two Mr BUMSTEADS seated upon the
stepladders with a lantern babylike on each knee
You two men are awake at last eh say the organists with peculiar
smiles
Yes gentlemen return the MCLAUGHLINS with yawns
They ascend silently from the cellar each believing that he is
accompanied by two companions and rendered moodily distrustful thereby
Aina maina monaMike
Bassalone bonaStrike
sings a small familiar voice when they stand again above ground and a
stone whizzes between their heads
In another moment BUMSTEAD has the fell SMALLEY by the collar and is
shaking him like a yard of carpet
You wretched little tarrier he cries in a fury youve been spying
around tonight to find out something about my Spiritualism that may be
distorted to injure my Ritualistic standing
I aint done nothing and you jest drop me or Ill knock spots out of
yer carols the stony young child I jest come to have my aim at that
old Beat there
Attend to his case thenhis and his friends for he seems to have
some one with himand never let me see you two boys again
Thus Mr BUMSTEAD as he releases the excited lad and turns from the
pauper burialground for a curious kind of pitching and running walk
homeward The strange expedition is at an endbut which end he is
unable just then to decide

know whether he has any remedy in the courts His best way is the way
home
RiflemanYou are right the rival gunsthe Dreyse and the

the test under present circumstances in Europe it rather appears that
both of them will prove Needless

supposed feebleness attributable to it If you take a round of the

THE PLAYS AND SHOWS
As a good many persons know LA GISELLE is a ballet whose hundred legs
are nightly displayed on the stage of the GRAND OPERA HOUSE
The Twelve Temptations have ceased to tempt and the familiar legs of
LUPE no longer allure But in their place we have KATHI LANNER and
BERTHA LIND and nearly a gross of assorted legs of the very best
quality
Why do the women clamor for the ballot when they have almost exclusive
possession of the ballet The latter is much nicer and more useful than
the former The average repeater can obtain only a dollar for his
ballot but the average ballet will find any quantity of enthusiastic
admirers at one dollar and a half a head Would any man pay KATHI LANNER
a dollar for the privilege of seeing her with a ballot in her hand
On the other hand lives there a man with eyes so dead that he would not
cheerfully pay twice that sum to see her in the mazes of the ballet
But La Giselle Certainly I am coming to that in a moment I have
often thought that nature must have intended me for a writer of sermons
I have such a facility for beginning an article with a series of general
remarks that have nothing whatever to do with the subject
Though how can any one be rationally expected to stick to anything in
this weather except perhaps the newly varnished surface of his desk
And how can even the firmest of resolutions be prevented from melting
and vanishing away with the thermometer at more degrees than one likes
to mention You remember the old proverb Man proposes but his
motherinlaw finally disposes The bearing of this observation lies in
its application
By the bye I dont know a better application in the present weather
than claret punch Apply yourself continually to that cooling beverage
and apply it continually to your lips and the result is a sort of
reciprocity treat whose results are much more certain than those of the
reciprocity treaty of which Congress has latterly had so much to say
To contemplate La Giselle in all its bearings is a pleasure which is
peculiarly appropriate to the season KATHI LANNER and her companions
may not be really cool but they look as though they were They remind
one of the East Indian country houses that are built on posts so as to
allow a free circulation of air beneath the foundation Anyhow they
look as if they took things coolly
A joke might be made on the words coolly and Coolie The reader may mix
to his own taste Its too hot for any one to make jokes for other
people
But La Giselle Yes yes I am just ready to speak of it La Giselle
is a grand ballet in which an elaborate plot is developed by the toes of
some fifty young ladies There is a young woman in it who loves a man
and there is another woman who also loves him and another man who loves
the first woman and meddles and mars as though he were a professional
philanthropist
The womanthe first woman I meangoes crazy down to the extremity of
her feet and dies and then there are more womenno these last are
disembodied spirits with nothing but light skirts onwho dance in
graveyards and make young men dance with them till they fall down
exhausted calling in vain for BROWN to take them home in carriages and
pay for their torn gloves The first young woman and a young mannot
the other young man you understanddoes a good deal ofWell in
fact things are rather mixed before the ballet comes to an end but I
know that its a good thing for FISK sits in his private box and
applauds it which he wouldnt do if he didnt
And now having placed La Giselle plainly before your mental vision I
desire to rise to a personal explanation For the ensuing four weeks
the places in PUNCHINELLO which have heretofore known me will
know me no more I am going to a quiet country place on Long Island to
write war correspondence for thewell I wont mention the name of the
paper You see the editor of the Na of the paper in question I
should saywants to have an independent and unprejudiced account of
the great struggle on the Rhinesomething that shall be different from
any other accountDown on Long Island I shall be out of the reach of
either French or Prussian influence and will be able to describe events
as they should be I have made arrangements with the Veteran Observer
of the Times to take charge of this column during my absence If he
can only curb his natural tendency toward frivolity and jocoseness I am
in hopes that he will be able to draw his salary as promptly and
efficiently as though he were a younger man Remarking therefore in
the words of Kathleen Mavourneen that my absence may be four weeks
and it may be longer I bid my readers a warm thermometer one hundred
and five degrees farewell
