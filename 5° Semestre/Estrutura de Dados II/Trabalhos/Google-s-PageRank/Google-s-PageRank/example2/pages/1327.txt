and she answers from her tree a little way off musical notes
beautifully assenting to and completing her lords remark as becomes
a properly constructed German sheowl They say the same thing over and
over again so emphatically that I think it must be something nasty about
me but I shall not let myself be frightened away by the sarcasm of
owls
This is less a garden than a wilderness No one has lived in the house
much less in the garden for twentyfive years and it is such a
pretty old place that the people who might have lived here and did
not deliberately preferring the horrors of a flat in a town must have
belonged to that vast number of eyeless and earless persons of whom the
world seems chiefly composed Noseless too though it does not sound
pretty but the greater part of my spring happiness is due to the scent
of the wet earth and young leaves
I am always happy out of doors be it understood for indoors there
are servants and furniture but in quite different ways and my spring
happiness bears no resemblance to my summer or autumn happiness though
it is not more intense and there were days last winter when I danced
for sheer joy out in my frostbound garden in spite of my years and
children But I did it behind a bush having a due regard for the
decencies
There are so many birdcherries round me great trees with branches
sweeping the grass and they are so wreathed just now with white
blossoms and tenderest green that the garden looks like a wedding
I never saw such masses of them they seemed to fill the place Even
across a little stream that bounds the garden on the east and right in
the middle of the cornfield beyond there is an immense one a picture
of grace and glory against the cold blue of the spring sky
My garden is surrounded by cornfields and meadows and beyond are great
stretches of sandy heath and pine forests and where the forests leave
off the bare heath begins again but the forests are beautiful in
their lofty pinkstemmed vastness far overhead the crowns of softest
graygreen and underfoot a bright green wortleberry carpet and
everywhere the breathless silence and the bare heaths are beautiful
too for one can see across them into eternity almost and to go out on
to them with ones face towards the setting sun is like going into the
very presence of God
In the middle of this plain is the oasis of birdcherries and greenery
where I spend my happy days and in the middle of the oasis is the gray
stone house with many gables where I pass my reluctant nights The house
is very old and has been added to at various times It was a convent
before the Thirty Years War and the vaulted chapel with its brick
floor worn by pious peasant knees is now used as a hall Gustavus
Adolphus and his Swedes passed through more than once as is duly
recorded in archives still preserved for we are on what was then the
highroad between Sweden and Brandenburg the unfortunate The Lion of
the North was no doubt an estimable person and acted wholly up to his
convictions but he must have sadly upset the peaceful nuns who were
not without convictions of their own sending them out on to the wide
empty plain to piteously seek some life to replace the life of silence
here
From nearly all the windows of the house I can look out across the
plain with no obstacle in the shape of a hill right away to a blue
line of distant forest and on the west side uninterruptedly to the
setting sunnothing but a green rolling plain with a sharp edge
against the sunset I love those west windows better than any others
and have chosen my bedroom on that side of the house so that even times
of hairbrushing may not be entirely lost and the young woman who
attends to such matters has been taught to fulfil her duties about a
mistress recumbent in an easychair before an open window and not to
profane with chatter that sweet and solemn time This girl is grieved
at my habit of living almost in the garden and all her ideas as to the
sort of life a respectable German lady should lead have got into a sad
muddle since she came to me The people round about are persuaded that I
am to put it as kindly as possible exceedingly eccentric for the news
has travelled that I spend the day out of doors with a book and that no
mortal eye has ever yet seen me sew or cook But why cook when you can
get some one to cook for you And as for sewing the maids will hem the
sheets better and quicker than I could and all forms of needlework of
the fancy order are inventions of the evil one for keeping the foolish
from applying their heart to wisdom
We had been married five years before it struck us that we might as well
make use of this place by coming down and living in it Those five years
were spent in a flat in a town and during their whole interminable
length I was perfectly miserable and perfectly healthy which disposes
of the ugly notion that has at times disturbed me that my happiness here
is less due to the garden than to a good digestion And while we were
wasting our lives there here was this dear place with dandelions up
to the very door all the paths grassgrown and completely effaced in
winter so lonely with nobody but the north wind taking the least notice
of it and in Mayin all those five lovely Maysno one to look at
the wonderful birdcherries and still more wonderful masses of lilacs
everything glowing and blowing the virginia creeper madder every year
until at last in October the very roof was wreathed with bloodred
tresses the owls and the squirrels and all the blessed little birds
reigning supreme and not a living creature ever entering the empty
house except the snakes which got into the habit during those silent
years of wriggling up the south wall into the rooms on that side
whenever the old housekeeper opened the windows All that was
herepeace and happiness and a reasonable lifeand yet it never
struck me to come and live in it Looking back I am astonished and can
in no way account for the tardiness of my discovery that here in this
faraway corner was my kingdom of heaven Indeed so little did it
enter my head to even use the place in summer that I submitted to weeks
of seaside life with all its horrors every year until at last in
the early spring of last year having come down for the opening of the
village school and wandering out afterwards into the bare and desolate
garden I dont know what smell of wet earth or rotting leaves brought
back my childhood with a rush and all the happy days I had spent in a
garden Shall I ever forget that day It was the beginning of my real
life my coming of age as it were and entering into my kingdom Early
March gray quiet skies and brown quiet earth leafless and sad
and lonely enough out there in the damp and silence yet there I stood
feeling the same rapture of pure delight in the first breath of spring
that I used to as a child and the five wasted years fell from me like a
cloak and the world was full of hope and I vowed myself then and there
to nature and have been happy ever since
My other half being indulgent and with some faint thought perhaps that
it might be as well to look after the place consented to live in it
at any rate for a time whereupon followed six specially blissful weeks
from the end of April into June during which I was here alone supposed
to be superintending the painting and papering but as a matter of fact
only going into the house when the workmen had gone out of it
How happy I was I dont remember any time quite so perfect since the
days when I was too little to do lessons and was turned out with sugar
on my eleven oclock bread and butter on to a lawn closely strewn with
dandelions and daisies The sugar on the bread and butter has lost its
charm but I love the dandelions and daisies even more passionately now
than then and never would endure to see them all mown away if I were
not certain that in a day or two they would be pushing up their little
faces again as jauntily as ever During those six weeks I lived in a
world of dandelions and delights The dandelions carpeted the three
lawnsthey used to be lawns but have long since blossomed out into
meadows filled with every sort of pretty weedand under and among the
groups of leafless oaks and beeches were blue hepaticas white anemones
violets and celandines in sheets The celandines in particular
delighted me with their clean happy brightness so beautifully trim
and newly varnished as though they too had had the painters at work
on them Then when the anemones went came a few stray periwinkles and
Solomons Seal and all the birdcherries blossomed in a burst And then
before I had a little got used to the joy of their flowers against the
sky came the lilacsmasses and masses of them in clumps on the
grass with other shrubs and trees by the side of walks and one great
continuous bank of them half a mile long right past the west front of
the house away down as far as one could see shining glorious against
a background of firs When that time came and when before it was
over the acacias all blossomed too and four great clumps of pale
silverypink peonies flowered under the south windows I felt so
absolutely happy and blest and thankful and grateful that I really
cannot describe it My days seemed to melt away in a dream of pink and
purple peace
There were only the old housekeeper and her handmaiden in the house so
that on the plea of not giving too much trouble I could indulge what my
other half calls my fantaisie dereglee as regards mealsthat is to
say meals so simple that they could be brought out to the lilacs on
a tray and I lived I remember on salad and bread and tea the whole
time sometimes a very tiny pigeon appearing at lunch to save me as
the old lady thought from starvation Who but a woman could have stood
salad for six weeks even salad sanctified by the presence and scent
of the most gorgeous lilac masses I did and grew in grace every day
though I have never liked it since How often now oppressed by the
necessity of assisting at three diningroom meals daily two of which
are conducted by the functionaries held indispensable to a proper
maintenance of the family dignity and all of which are pervaded by
joints of meat how often do I think of my salad days forty in number
and of the blessedness of being alone as I was then alone
And then the evenings when the workmen had all gone and the house was
left to emptiness and echoes and the old housekeeper had gathered up
her rheumatic limbs into her bed and my little room in quite another
part of the house had been set ready how reluctantly I used to leave
the friendly frogs and owls and with my heart somewhere down in my
shoes lock the door to the garden behind me and pass through the long
series of echoing south rooms full of shadows and ladders and ghostly
pails of painters mess and humming a tune to make myself believe
I liked it go rather slowly across the brickfloored hall up the
creaking stairs down the long whitewashed passage and with a final
rush of panic whisk into my room and double lock and bolt the door
There were no bells in the house and I used to take a great dinnerbell
to bed with me so that at least I might be able to make a noise if
frightened in the night though what good it would have been I dont
know as there was no one to hear The housemaid slept in another little
cell opening out of mine and we two were the only living creatures in
the great empty west wing She evidently did not believe in ghosts for
I could hear how she fell asleep immediately after getting into bed nor
do I believe in them mais je les redoute as a French lady said who
from her books appears to have been strongminded
The dinnerbell was a great solace it was never rung but it comforted
me to see it on the chair beside my bed as my nights were anything but
placid it was all so strange and there were such queer creakings and
other noises I used to lie awake for hours startled out of a light
sleep by the cracking of some board and listen to the indifferent
snores of the girl in the next room In the morning of course I was as
brave as a lion and much amused at the cold perspirations of the night
before but even the nights seem to me now to have been delightful
and myself like those historic boys who heard a voice in every wind
and snatched a fearful joy I would gladly shiver through them all
over again for the sake of the beautiful purity of the house empty of
servants and upholstery
How pretty the bedrooms looked with nothing in them but their cheerful
new papers Sometimes I would go into those that were finished and build
all sorts of castles in the air about their future and their past Would
the nuns who had lived in them know their little whitewashed cells
again all gay with delicate flower papers and clean white paint And
how astonished they would be to see cell No 14 turned into a bathroom
with a bath big enough to insure a cleanliness of body equal to their
purity of soul They would look upon it as a snare of the tempter and I
know that in my own case I only began to be shocked at the blackness of
my nails the day that I began to lose the first whiteness of my soul by
falling in love at fifteen with the parish organist or rather with the
glimpse of surplice and Roman nose and fiery moustache which was all
I ever saw of him and which I loved to distraction for at least six
months at the end of which time going out with my governess one day I
passed him in the street and discovered that his unofficial garb was
a frockcoat combined with a turndown collar and a bowler hat and
never loved him any more
The first part of that time of blessedness was the most perfect for
I had not a thought of anything but the peace and beauty all round me
Then he appeared suddenly who has a right to appear when and how he will
and rebuked me for never having written and when I told him that I had
been literally too happy to think of writing he seemed to take it as a
reflection on himself that I could be happy alone I took him round the
garden along the new paths I had had made and showed him the acacia and
lilac glories and he said that it was the purest selfishness to enjoy
myself when neither he nor the offspring were with me and that the
lilacs wanted thoroughly pruning I tried to appease him by offering him
the whole of my salad and toast supper which stood ready at the foot of
the little verandah steps when we came back but nothing appeased that
Man of Wrath and he said he would go straight back to the neglected
family So he went and the remainder of the precious time was disturbed
by twinges of conscience to which I am much subject whenever I found
myself wanting to jump for joy I went to look at the painters every
time my feet were for taking me to look at the garden I trotted
diligently up and down the passages I criticised and suggested and
commanded more in one day than I had done in all the rest of the time
I wrote regularly and sent my love but I could not manage to fret and
yearn What are you to do if your conscience is clear and your liver in
order and the sun is shining
May 10thI knew nothing whatever last year about gardening and this
year know very little more but I have dawnings of what may be done and
have at least made one great stridefrom ipomaea to tearoses
The garden was an absolute wilderness It is all round the house but
the principal part is on the south side and has evidently always been
so The south front is onestoried a long series of rooms opening one
into the other and the walls are covered with virginia creeper There
is a little verandah in the middle leading by a flight of rickety
wooden steps down into what seems to have been the only spot in the
whole place that was ever cared for This is a semicircle cut into the
lawn and edged with privet and in this semicircle are eleven beds of
different sizes bordered with box and arranged round a sundial and the
sundial is very venerable and mossgrown and greatly beloved by me
These beds were the only sign of any attempt at gardening to be seen
except a solitary crocus that came up all by itself each spring in the
grass not because it wanted to but because it could not help it and
these I had sown with ipomaea the whole eleven having found a German
gardening book according to which ipomaea in vast quantities was the
one thing needful to turn the most hideous desert into a paradise
Nothing else in that book was recommended with anything like the same
warmth and being entirely ignorant of the quantity of seed necessary I
bought ten pounds of it and had it sown not only in the eleven beds
but round nearly every tree and then waited in great agitation for the
promised paradise to appear It did not and I learned my first lesson
Luckily I had sown two great patches of sweetpeas which made me very
happy all the summer and then there were some sunflowers and a few
hollyhocks under the south windows with Madonna lilies in between But
the lilies after being transplanted disappeared to my great dismay
for how was I to know it was the way of lilies And the hollyhocks
turned out to be rather ugly colours so that my first summer was
decorated and beautified solely by sweetpeas At present we are only
just beginning to breathe after the bustle of getting new beds and
borders and paths made in time for this summer The eleven beds round
the sundial are filled with roses but I see already that I have
made mistakes with some As I have not a living soul with whom to hold
communion on this or indeed on any matter my only way of learning is
by making mistakes All eleven were to have been carpeted with purple
pansies but finding that I had not enough and that nobody had any to
sell me only six have got their pansies the others being sown with
dwarf mignonette Two of the eleven are filled with Marie van Houtte
roses two with Viscountess Folkestone two with Laurette Messimy one
with Souvenir de la Malmaison one with Adam and Devoniensis two with
Persian Yellow and Bicolor and one big bed behind the sundial with
three sorts of red roses seventytwo in all Duke of Teck Cheshunt
Scarlet and Prefet de Limburg This bed is I am sure a mistake and
several of the others are I think but of course I must wait and see
being such an ignorant person Then I have had two long beds made in the
grass on either side of the semicircle each sown with mignonette and
one filled with Marie van Houtte and the other with Jules Finger and
the Bride and in a warm corner under the drawingroom windows is a
bed of Madame Lambard Madame de Watteville and Comtesse Riza du Parc
while farther down the garden sheltered on the north and west by a
group of beeches and lilacs is another large bed containing Rubens
Madame Joseph Schwartz and the Hen Edith Gifford All these roses are
dwarf I have only two standards in the whole garden two Madame George
Bruants and they look like broomsticks How I long for the day when
the tearoses open their buds Never did I look forward so intensely to
anything and every day I go the rounds admiring what the dear little
things have achieved in the twentyfour hours in the way of new leaf or
increase of lovely red shoot
The hollyhocks and lilies now flourishing are still under the south
windows in a narrow border on the top of a grass slope at the foot of
which I have sown two long borders of sweetpeas facing the rose beds so
that my roses may have something almost as sweet as themselves to
look at until the autumn when everything is to make place for more
tearoses The path leading away from this semicircle down the garden is
bordered with China roses white and pink with here and there a Persian
Yellow I wish now I had put tearoses there and I have misgivings as
to the effect of the Persian Yellows among the Chinas for the Chinas
are such wee little baby things and the Persian Yellows look as though
they intended to be big bushes
There is not a creature in all this part of the world who could in the
least understand with what heartbeatings I am looking forward to the
flowering of these roses and not a German gardening book that does not
relegate all tearoses to hothouses imprisoning them for life and
depriving them for ever of the breath of God It was no doubt because I
was so ignorant that I rushed in where Teutonic angels fear to tread and
made my tearoses face a northern winter but they did face it under
fir branches and leaves and not one has suffered and they are looking
today as happy and as determined to enjoy themselves as any roses I am
sure in Europe
May 14thToday I am writing on the verandah with the three babies
more persistent than mosquitoes raging round me and already several of
the thirty fingers have been in the inkpot and the owners consoled when
duty pointed to rebukes But who can rebuke such penitent and drooping
sunbonnets I can see nothing but sunbonnets and pinafores and nimble
black legs
These three their patient nurse myself the gardener and the
gardeners assistant are the only people who ever go into my garden
but then neither are we ever out of it The gardener has been here a
year and has given me notice regularly on the first of every month but
up to now has been induced to stay on On the first of this month he
came as usual and with determination written on every feature told me
he intended to go in June and that nothing should alter his decision
I dont think he knows much about gardening but he can at least dig and
water and some of the things he sows come up and some of the plants
he plants grow besides which he is the most unflaggingly industrious
person I ever saw and has the great merit of never appearing to take
the faintest interest in what we do in the garden So I have tried to
keep him on not knowing what the next one may be like and when I asked
him what he had to complain of and he replied Nothing I could only
conclude that he has a personal objection to me because of my eccentric
preference for plants in groups rather than plants in lines Perhaps
too he does not like the extracts from gardening books I read to him
sometimes when he is planting or sowing something new Being so helpless
myself I thought it simpler instead of explaining to take the
book itself out to him and let him have wisdom at its very source
administering it in doses while he worked I quite recognise that this
must be annoying and only my anxiety not to lose a whole year through
some stupid mistake has given me the courage to do it I laugh
sometimes behind the book at his disgusted face and wish we could be
photographed so that I may be reminded in twenty years time when the
garden is a bower of loveliness and I learned in all its ways of my
first happy struggles and failures
All through April he was putting the perennials we had sown in the
autumn into their permanent places and all through April he went about
with a long piece of string making parallel lines down the borders of
beautiful exactitude and arranging the poor plants like soldiers at a
review Two long borders were done during my absence one day and when I
explained that I should like the third to have plants in groups and
not in lines and that what I wanted was a natural effect with no bare
spaces of earth to be seen he looked even more gloomily hopeless than
usual and on my going out later on to see the result I found he had
planted two long borders down the sides of a straight walk with little
lines of five plants in a rowfirst five pinks and next to them five
rockets and behind the rockets five pinks and behind the pinks five
rockets and so on with different plants of every sort and size down to
the end When I protested he said he had only carried out my orders
and had known it would not look well so I gave in and the remaining
borders were done after the pattern of the first two and I will have
patience and see how they look this summer before digging them up
again for it becomes beginners to be humble
If I could only dig and plant myself How much easier besides being so
fascinating to make your own holes exactly where you want them and put
in your plants exactly as you choose instead of giving orders that can
only be half understood from the moment you depart from the lines laid
down by that long piece of string In the first ecstasy of having a
garden all my own and in my burning impatience to make the waste places
blossom like a rose I did one warm Sunday in last years April during
the servants dinner hour doubly secure from the gardener by the day
and the dinner slink out with a spade and a rake and feverishly dig a
little piece of ground and break it up and sow surreptitious ipomaea
and run back very hot and guilty into the house and get into a chair
and behind a book and look languid just in time to save my reputation
And why not It is not graceful and it makes one hot but it is a
blessed sort of work and if Eve had had a spade in Paradise and known
what to do with it we should not have had all that sad business of the
apple
What a happy woman I am living in a garden with books babies
birds and flowers and plenty of leisure to enjoy them Yet my town
acquaintances look upon it as imprisonment and burying and I dont
know what besides and would rend the air with their shrieks if
condemned to such a life Sometimes I feel as if I were blest above all
my fellows in being able to find my happiness so easily I believe I
should always be good if the sun always shone and could enjoy myself
very well in Siberia on a fine day And what can life in town offer in
the way of pleasure to equal the delight of any one of the calm evenings
I have had this month sitting alone at the foot of the verandah steps
with the perfume of young larches all about and the May moon hanging
low over the beeches and the beautiful silence made only more profound
in its peace by the croaking of distant frogs and hooting of owls A
cockchafer darting by close to my ear with a loud hum sends a shiver
through me partly of pleasure at the reminder of past summers and
partly of fear lest he should get caught in my hair The Man of Wrath
says they are pernicious creatures and should be killed I would rather
get the killing done at the end of the summer and not crush them out of
such a pretty world at the very beginning of all the fun
This has been quite an eventful afternoon My eldest baby born in
April is five years old and the youngest born in June is three
so that the discerning will at once be able to guess the age of the
remaining middle or May baby While I was stooping over a group of
hollyhocks planted on the top of the only thing in the shape of a hill
the garden possesses the April baby who had been sitting pensive on a
tree stump close by got up suddenly and began to run aimlessly about
shrieking and wringing her hands with every symptom of terror I stared
wondering what had come to her and then I saw that a whole army of
young cows pasturing in a field next to the garden had got through the
hedge and were grazing perilously near my tearoses and most precious
belongings The nurse and I managed to chase them away but not before
they had trampled down a border of pinks and lilies in the cruellest
way and made great holes in a bed of China roses and even begun to
nibble at a Jackmanni clematis that I am trying to persuade to climb
up a tree trunk The gloomy gardener happened to be ill in bed and the
assistant was at vespersas Lutheran Germany calls afternoon tea or its
equivalentso the nurse filled up the holes as well as she could with
mould burying the crushed and mangled roses cheated for ever of their
hopes of summer glory and I stood by looking on dejectedly The June
baby who is two feet square and valiant beyond her size and years
seized a stick much bigger than herself and went after the cows the
cowherd being nowhere to be seen She planted herself in front of them
brandishing her stick and they stood in a row and stared at her in
great astonishment and she kept them off until one of the men from
the farm arrived with a whip and having found the cowherd sleeping
peacefully in the shade gave him a sound beating The cowherd is a
great hulking young man much bigger than the man who beat him but he
took his punishment as part of the days work and made no remark of any
sort It could not have hurt him much through his leather breeches and
I think he deserved it but it must be demoralising work for a
strong young man with no brains looking after cows Nobody with less
imagination than a poet ought to take it up as a profession
After the June baby and I had been welcomed back by the other two with
as many hugs as though we had been restored to them from great perils
and while we were peacefully drinking tea under a beech tree I happened
to look up into its mazy green and there on a branch quite close to my
head sat a little baby owl I got on the seat and caught it easily for
it could not fly and how it had reached the branch at all is a mystery
It is a little round ball of gray fluff with the quaintest wisest
solemn face Poor thing I ought to have let it go but the temptation
to keep it until the Man of Wrath at present on a journey has seen it
was not to be resisted as he has often said how much he would like to
have a young owl and try and tame it So I put it into a roomy cage and
slung it up on a branch near where it had been sitting and which cannot
be far from its nest and its mother We had hardly subsided again to our
tea when I saw two more balls of fluff on the ground in the long grass
and scarcely distinguishable at a little distance from small molehills
These were promptly united to their relation in the cage and now when
the Man of Wrath comes home not only shall he be welcomed by a wife
decked with the orthodox smiles but by the three little longedfor
owls Only it seems wicked to take them from their mother and I know
that I shall let them go again some dayperhaps the very next time the
Man of Wrath goes on a journey I put a small pot of water in the cage
though they never could have tasted water yet unless they drink the
raindrops off the beech leaves I suppose they get all the liquid they
need from the bodies of the mice and other dainties provided for them by
their fond parents But the raindrop idea is prettier
May 15thHow cruel it was of me to put those poor little owls into a
cage even for one night I cannot forgive myself and shall never pander
to the Man of Wraths wishes again This morning I got up early to see
how they were getting on and I found the door of the cage wide open
and no owls to be seen I thought of course that somebody had stolen
themsome boy from the village or perhaps the chastised cowherd But
looking about I saw one perched high up in the branches of the beech
tree and then to my dismay one lying dead on the ground The third was
nowhere to be seen and is probably safe in its nest The parents must
have torn at the bars of the cage until by chance they got the door
open and then dragged the little ones out and up into the tree The
one that is dead must have been blown off the branch as it was a windy
night and its neck is broken There is one happy life less in the garden
today through my fault and it is such a lovely warm dayjust the
sort of weather for young soft things to enjoy and grow in The babies
are greatly distressed and are digging a grave and preparing funeral
wreaths of dandelions
Just as I had written that I heard sounds of arrival and running out
I breathlessly told the Man of Wrath how nearly I had been able to give
him the owls he has so often said he would like to have and how sorry
I was they were gone and how grievous the death of one and so on after
the voluble manner of women
He listened till I paused to breathe and then he said I am surprised
at such cruelty How could you make the mother owl suffer so She had
never done you any harm
Which sent me out of the house and into the garden more convinced than
ever that he sang true who sang
Two paradises twere in one to live in Paradise alone
May 16thThe garden is the place I go to for refuge and shelter not
the house In the house are duties and annoyances servants to exhort
and admonish furniture and meals but out there blessings crowd round
me at every stepit is there that I am sorry for the unkindness in me
for those selfish thoughts that are so much worse than they feel it
is there that all my sins and silliness are forgiven there that I feel
protected and at home and every flower and weed is a friend and every
tree a lover When I have been vexed I run out to them for comfort
and when I have been angry without just cause it is there that I find
absolution Did ever a woman have so many friends And always the same
always ready to welcome me and fill me with cheerful thoughts Happy
children of a common Father why should I their own sister be less
content and joyous than they Even in a thunder storm when other people
are running into the house I run out of it I do not like thunder
stormsthey frighten me for hours before they come because I always
feel them on the way but it is odd that I should go for shelter to the
garden I feel better there more taken care of more petted When
it thunders the April baby says Theres lieber Gott scolding those
angels again And once when there was a storm in the night she
complained loudly and wanted to know why lieber Gott didnt do the
