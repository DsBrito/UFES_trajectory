allowconquer it whereas the German abandons himself to it without
scruple or reflection and is actually proud of his pious intemperance
and selfindulgence Nothing will cure him of this mania It may end
in starvation crushing taxation suppression of all freedom to try
new social experiments and reform obsolete institutions in snobbery
jobbery idolatry and an omnipresent tyranny in which his doctor and
his schoolmaster his lawyer and his priest coerce him worse than
any official or drill sergeant no matter it is respectable says the
German therefore it must be good and cannot be carried too far
and everybody who rebels against it must be a rascal Even the
SocialDemocrats in Germany differ from the rest only in carrying
academic orthodoxy beyond human endurancebeyond even German endurance
I am a Socialist and a Democrat myself the hero of a hundred platforms
one of the leaders of the most notable Socialist organizations in
England I am as conspicuous in English Socialism as Bebel is in German
Socialism but do you suppose that the German SocialDemocrats tolerate
me Not a bit of it I have begged again and again to be taken to the
bosom of my German comrades I have pleaded that the SuperProletarians
of all lands should unite I have pointed out that the German
SocialDemocratic party has done nothing at its Congresses for the last
ten years except the things I told them to do ten years before and that
its path is white with the bones of the Socialist superstitions I and my
fellow Fabians have slain Useless They do not care a rap whether I
am a Socialist or not All they want to know is Am I orthodox Am I
correct in my revolutionary views Am I reverent to the revolutionary
authorities Because I am a genuine freethinker they look at me as a
policeman looks at a midnight prowler or as a Berlin bourgeois looks
at a suspicious foreigner They ask Do you believe that Marx was
omniscient and infallible that Engels was his prophet that Bebel and
Singer are his inspired apostles and that Das Kapital is the Bible
Hastening in my innocence to clear myself of what I regard as an
accusation of credulity and ignorance I assure them earnestly that
I know ten times as much of economics and a hundred times as much of
practical administration as Marx did that I knew Engels personally and
rather liked him as a witty and amiable old 1848 veteran who despised
modern Socialism that I regard Bebel and Singer as men of like passions
with myself but considerably less advanced and that I read Das Kapital
in the year 1882 or thereabouts and still consider it one of the
most important books of the nineteenth century because of its power
of changing the minds of those who read it in spite of its unsound
capitalist economics its parade of quotations from books which the
author had either not read or not understood its affectation of
algebraic formulas and its general attempt to disguise a masterpiece
of propagandist journalism and prophetic invective as a drily scientific
treatise of the sort that used to impose on people in 1860 when any
book that pretended to be scientific was accepted as a Bible In those
days Darwin and Helmholtz were the real fathers of the Church and
nobody would listen to religion poetry or rhetoric so that even
Socialism had to call itself scientific and predict the date of the
revolution as if it were a comet by calculations founded on historic
laws
To my amazement these reasonable remarks were received as hideous
blasphemies none of the party papers were allowed to print any word
of mine the very Revisionists themselves found that the scandal of my
heresy damaged them more than my support aided them and I found myself
an outcast from German SocialDemocracy at the moment when thanks to
Trebitsch the German bourgeoisie and nobility began to smile on me
seduced by the pleasure of playing with fire and perhaps by Agnes
Sormas acting as Candida
Thus you may see that when a German by becoming a SocialDemocrat
throws off all the bonds of convention and stands free from all
allegiance to established religion law order patriotism and
learning he promptly uses his freedom to put on a headier set of
chains expels antimilitarists with the bloodthirstiest martial
antiforeign ardor and gives the Kaiser reason to thank heaven that he
was born in the comparative freedom and Laodicean tolerance of Kingship
and not in the Calvinistic bigotry and pedantry of Marxism
Why then you may ask do I say that I am bound to Germany by the ties
that hold my nature most strongly Very simply because I should have
perished of despair in my youth but for the world created for me by that
great German dynasty which began with Bach and will perhaps not end with
Richard Strauss Do not suppose for a moment that I learnt my art from
English men of letters True they showed me how to handle English
words but if I had known no more than that my works would never
have crossed the Channel My masters were the masters of a universal
language they were to go from summit to summit Bach Handel Haydn
Mozart Beethoven and Wagner Had the Germans understood any of these
men they would have hanged them Fortunately they did not understand
them and therefore only neglected them until they were dead after
which they learnt to dance to their tunes with an easy conscience
For their sakes Germany stands consecrated as the Holy Land of the
capitalist age just as Italy for its painters sakes is the Holy Land
of the early unvulgarized Renascence France for its builders
sakes of the age of Christian chivalry and faith and Greece for its
sculptors sakes of the Periclean age
These Holy Lands are my fatherlands in them alone am I truly at home
all my work is but to bring the whole world under this sanctification
And so O worthy respectable dutiful patriotic brave industrious
German reader you who used to fear only God and your own conscience
and now fear nothing at all here is my book for you andin all
sinceritymuch good may it do you

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
The preparation of a Second Edition of this booklet is quite the most
unexpected literary task that has ever been set me When it first
appeared I was ungrateful enough to remonstrate with its publisher for
printing as I thought more copies than the most sanguine Wagnerite
could ever hope to sell But the result proved that exactly one person
buys a copy on every day in the year including Sundays and so in the
process of the suns a reprint has become necessary
Save a few verbal slips of no importance I have found nothing to alter
in this edition As usual the only protests the book has elicited are
protests not against the opinions it expresses but against the facts
it records There are people who cannot bear to be told that their
hero was associated with a famous Anarchist in a rebellion that he
was proclaimed as wanted by the police that he wrote revolutionary
pamphlets and that his picture of Niblunghome under the reign of
Alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it
was made known in Germany in the middle of the nineteenth century by
Engelss Condition of the Laboring classes in England They frantically
deny these facts and then declare that I have connected them with
Wagner in a paroxysm of senseless perversity I am sorry I have hurt
them and I appeal to charitable publishers to bring out a new life of
Wagner which shall describe him as a court musician of unquestioned
fashion and orthodoxy and a pillar of the most exclusive Dresden
circles Such a work would I believe have a large sale and be read
with satisfaction and reassurance by many lovers of Wagners music
As to my much demurredto relegation of Night Falls On The Gods to
the category of grand opera I have nothing to add or withdraw Such a
classification is to me as much a matter of fact as the Dresden rising
or the police proclamation but I shall not pretend that it is a matter
of such fact as everybodys judgment can grapple with People who prefer
grand opera to serious musicdrama naturally resent my placing a very
grand opera below a very serious musicdrama The ordinary lover of
Shakespeare would equally demur to my placing his popular catchpenny
plays of which As You Like It is an avowed type below true
Shakespearean plays like Measure for Measure I cannot help that
Popular dramas and operas may have overwhelming merits as enchanting
makebelieves but a poets sincerest vision of the world must always
take precedence of his prettiest fools paradise
As many English Wagnerites seem to be still under the impression that
Wagner composed Rienzi in his youth Tannhauser and Lohengrin in his
middle age and The Ring in his later years may I again remind them
that The Ring was the result of a political convulsion which occurred
when Wagner was only thirtysix and that the poem was completed when
he was forty with thirty more years of work before him It is as much
a first essay in political philosophy as Die Feen is a first essay in
romantic opera The attempt to recover its spirit twenty years later
when the music of Night Falls On The Gods was added was an attempt to
revive the barricades of Dresden in the Temple of the Grail Only those
who have never had any political enthusiasms to survive can believe that
such an attempt could succeed G B S
London 1901
Preface to the First Edition
This book is a commentary on The Ring of the Niblungs Wagners chief
work I offer it to those enthusiastic admirers of Wagner who are unable
to follow his ideas and do not in the least understand the dilemma of
Wotan though they are filled with indignation at the irreverence of the
Philistines who frankly avow that they find the remarks of the god too
often tedious and nonsensical Now to be devoted to Wagner merely as a
dog is devoted to his master sharing a few elementary ideas appetites
and emotions with him and for the rest reverencing his superiority
without understanding it is no true Wagnerism Yet nothing better
is possible without a stock of ideas common to master and disciple
Unfortunately the ideas of the revolutionary Wagner of 1848 are taught
neither by the education nor the experience of English and American
gentlemenamateurs who are almost always political mugwumps and hardly
ever associate with revolutionists The earlier attempts to translate
his numerous pamphlets and essays into English resulted in ludicrous
mixtures of pure nonsense with the absurdest distorsions of his ideas
into the ideas of the translators We now have a translation which is a
masterpiece of interpretation and an eminent addition to our literature
but that is not because its author Mr Ashton Ellis knows the German
dictionary better than his predecessors He is simply in possession of
Wagners ideas which were to them inconceivable
All I pretend to do in this book is to impart the ideas which are most
likely to be lacking in the conventional Englishmans equipment I came
by them myself much as Wagner did having learnt more about music
than about anything else in my youth and sown my political wild oats
subsequently in the revolutionary school This combination is not common
in England and as I seem so far to be the only publicly articulate
result of it I venture to add my commentary to what has already been
written by musicians who are no revolutionists and revolutionists who
are no musicians G B S

PRELIMINARY ENCOURAGEMENTS
A few of these will be welcome to the ordinary citizen visiting the
theatre to satisfy his curiosity or his desire to be in the fashion
by witnessing a representation of Richard Wagners famous Ring of the
Niblungs
First The Ring with all its gods and giants and dwarfs its
watermaidens and Valkyries its wishingcap magic ring enchanted
sword and miraculous treasure is a drama of today and not of a remote
and fabulous antiquity It could not have been written before the second
half of the nineteenth century because it deals with events which were
only then consummating themselves Unless the spectator recognizes in
it an image of the life he is himself fighting his way through it must
needs appear to him a monstrous development of the Christmas pantomimes
spun out here and there into intolerable lengths of dull conversation by
the principal baritone Fortunately even from this point of view The
Ring is full of extraordinarily attractive episodes both orchestral and
dramatic The nature music alonemusic of river and rainbow fire and
forestis enough to bribe people with any love of the country in them
to endure the passages of political philosophy in the sure hope of a
prettier page to come Everybody too can enjoy the love music the
hammer and anvil music the clumping of the giants the tune of the
young woodsmans horn the trilling of the bird the dragon music and
nightmare music and thunder and lightning music the profusion of simple
melody the sensuous charm of the orchestration in short the vast
extent of common ground between The Ring and the ordinary music we use
for play and pleasure Hence it is that the four separate musicplays
of which it is built have become popular throughout Europe as operas We
shall presently see that one of them Night Falls On The Gods actually
is an opera
It is generally understood however that there is an inner ring of
superior persons to whom the whole work has a most urgent and searching
philosophic and social significance I profess to be such a superior
person and I write this pamphlet for the assistance of those who wish
to be introduced to the work on equal terms with that inner circle of
adepts
My second encouragement is addressed to modest citizens who may suppose
themselves to be disqualified from enjoying The Ring by their technical
ignorance of music They may dismiss all such misgivings speedily and
confidently If the sound of music has any power to move them they will
find that Wagner exacts nothing further There is not a single bar of
classical music in The Ringnot a note in it that has any other point
than the single direct point of giving musical expression to the drama
In classical music there are as the analytical programs tell us first
subjects and second subjects free fantasias recapitulations and
codas there are fugues with countersubjects strettos and pedal
points there are passacaglias on ground basses canons ad hypodiapente
and other ingenuities which have after all stood or fallen by their
prettiness as much as the simplest folktune Wagner is never driving at
anything of this sort any more than Shakespeare in his plays is driving
at such ingenuities of versemaking as sonnets triolets and the like
And this is why he is so easy for the natural musician who has had no
academic teaching The professors when Wagners music is played to
them exclaim at once What is this Is it aria or recitative Is there
no cabaletta to itnot even a full close Why was that discord not
prepared and why does he not resolve it correctly How dare he indulge
in those scandalous and illicit transitions into a key that has not
one note in common with the key he has just left Listen to those false
relations What does he want with six drums and eight horns when Mozart
worked miracles with two of each The man is no musician The layman
neither knows nor cares about any of these things If Wagner were to
turn aside from his straightforward dramatic purpose to propitiate the
professors with correct exercises in sonata form his music would at
once become unintelligible to the unsophisticated spectator upon whom
the familiar and dreaded classical sensation would descend like the
influenza Nothing of the kind need be dreaded The unskilled untaught
musician may approach Wagner boldly for there is no possibility of a
misunderstanding between them The Ring music is perfectly single and
simple It is the adept musician of the old school who has everything to
unlearn and him I leave unpitied to his fate
THE RING OF THE NIBLUNGS
The Ring consists of four plays intended to be performed on four
successive evenings entitled The Rhine Gold a prologue to the other
three The Valkyries Siegfried and Night Falls On The Gods or in
the original German Das Rheingold Die Walkure Siegfried and Die
Gotterdammerung
THE RHINE GOLD
Let me assume for a moment that you are a young and goodlooking woman
Try to imagine yourself in that character at Klondyke five years ago
The place is teeming with gold If you are content to leave the gold
alone as the wise leave flowers without plucking them enjoying with
perfect naivete its color and glitter and preciousness no human being
will ever be the worse for your knowledge of it and whilst you remain
in that frame of mind the golden age will endure
Now suppose a man comes along a man who has no sense of the golden
age nor any power of living in the present a man with common desires
cupidities ambitions just like most of the men you know Suppose you
reveal to that man the fact that if he will only pluck this gold up
and turn it into money millions of men driven by the invisible whip
of hunger will toil underground and overground night and day to pile
up more and more gold for him until he is master of the world You will
find that the prospect will not tempt him so much as you might imagine
because it involves some distasteful trouble to himself to start with
and because there is something else within his reach involving no
distasteful toil which he desires more passionately and that is
yourself So long as he is preoccupied with love of you the gold and
all that it implies will escape him the golden age will endure Not
until he forswears love will he stretch out his hand to the gold and
found the Plutonic empire for himself But the choice between love and
gold may not rest altogether with him He may be an ugly ungracious
unamiable person whose affections may seem merely ludicrous and
despicable to you In that case you may repulse him and most bitterly
humiliate and disappoint him What is left to him then but to curse the
love he can never win and turn remorselessly to the gold With that
he will make short work of your golden age and leave you lamenting its
lost thoughtlessness and sweetness
In due time the gold of Klondyke will find its way to the great cities
of the world But the old dilemma will keep continually reproducing
itself The man who will turn his back on love and upon all the
fruitful it and will set himself singleheartedly to gather gold in an
exultant dream of wielding its Plutonic powers will find the treasure
yielding quickly to his touch But few men will make this sacrifice
voluntarily Not until the Plutonic power is so strongly set up that the
higher human impulses are suppressed as rebellious and even the mere
appetites are denied starved and insulted when they cannot purchase
their satisfaction with gold are the energetic spirits driven to build
their lives upon riches How inevitable that course has become to us is
plain enough to those who have the power of understanding what they see
as they look at the plutocratic societies of our modern capitals
First Scene
Here then is the subject of the first scene of The Rhine Gold As
you sit waiting for the curtain to rise you suddenly catch the booming
groundtone of a mighty river It becomes plainer clearer you get
nearer to the surface and catch the green light and the flights of
bubbles Then the curtain goes up and you see what you heardthe depths
of the Rhine with three strange fairy fishes half watermaidens
singing and enjoying themselves exuberantly They are not singing
barcarolles or ballads about the Lorely and her fated lovers but simply
trolling any nonsense that comes into their heads in time to the dancing
of the water and the rhythm of their swimming It is the golden age and
the attraction of this spot for the Rhine maidens is a lump of the Rhine
gold which they value in an entirely uncommercial way for its bodily
beauty and splendor Just at present it is eclipsed because the sun is
not striking down through the water
Presently there comes a poor devil of a dwarf stealing along the
slippery rocks of the river bed a creature with energy enough to make
him strong of body and fierce of passion but with a brutish narrowness
of intelligence and selfishness of imagination too stupid to see that
his own welfare can only be compassed as part of the welfare of the
world too full of brute force not to grab vigorously at his own gain
Such dwarfs are quite common in London He comes now with a fruitful
impulse in him in search of what he lacks in himself beauty lightness
of heart imagination music The Rhine maidens representing all these
to him fill him with hope and longing and he never considers that he
has nothing to offer that they could possibly desire being by natural
limitation incapable of seeing anything from anyone elses point of
view With perfect simplicity he offers himself as a sweetheart to
them But they are thoughtless elemental only half real things much
like modern young ladies That the poor dwarf is repulsive to their
sense of physical beauty and their romantic conception of heroism that
he is ugly and awkward greedy and ridiculous disposes for them of his
claim to live and love They mock him atrociously pretending to fall in
love with him at first sight and then slipping away and making game of
him heaping ridicule and disgust on the poor wretch until he is beside
himself with mortification and rage They forget him when the water
begins to glitter in the sun and the gold to reflect its glory They
break into ecstatic worship of their treasure and though they know the
parable of Klondyke quite well they have no fear that the gold will be
wrenched away by the dwarf since it will yield to no one who has not
forsworn love for it and it is in pursuit of love that he has come to
them They forget that they have poisoned that desire in him by their
mockery and denial of it and that he now knows that life will give him
nothing that he cannot wrest from it by the Plutonic power It is just
as if some poor rough vulgar coarse fellow were to offer to take his
part in aristocratic society and be snubbed into the knowledge that
only as a millionaire could he ever hope to bring that society to his
feet and buy himself a beautiful and refined wife His choice is forced
on him He forswears love as thousands of us forswear it every day and
in a moment the gold is in his grasp and he disappears in the depths
leaving the waterfairies vainly screaming Stop thief whilst the
river seems to plunge into darkness and sink from us as we rise to the
cloud regions above
And now what forces are there in the world to resist Alberic our
dwarf in his new character of sworn plutocrat He is soon at
work wielding the power of the gold For his gain hordes of his
fellowcreatures are thenceforth condemned to slave miserably
overground and underground lashed to their work by the invisible whip
of starvation They never see him any more than the victims of our
dangerous trades ever see the shareholders whose power is nevertheless
everywhere driving them to destruction The very wealth they create
with their labor becomes an additional force to impoverish them for as
fast as they make it it slips from their hands into the hands of their
master and makes him mightier than ever You can see the process for
yourself in every civilized country today where millions of people toil
in want and disease to heap up more wealth for our Alberics laying up
nothing for themselves except sometimes horrible and agonizing disease
and the certainty of premature death All this part of the story is
frightfully real frightfully present frightfully modern and its
effects on our social life are so ghastly and ruinous that we no longer
know enough of happiness to be discomposed by it It is only the
poet with his vision of what life might be to whom these things are
unendurable If we were a race of poets we would make an end of them
before the end of this miserable century Being a race of moral dwarfs
instead we think them highly respectable comfortable and proper and
allow them to breed and multiply their evil in all directions If there
were no higher power in the world to work against Alberic the end of it
would be utter destruction
Such a force there is however and it is called Godhead The mysterious
thing we call life organizes itself into all living shapes bird beast
beetle and fish rising to the human marvel in cunning dwarfs and
in laborious muscular giants capable these last of enduring
toil willing to buy love and life not with suicidal curses and
renunciations but with patient manual drudgery in the service of higher
powers And these higher powers are called into existence by the same
selforganization of life still more wonderfully into rare persons who
may by comparison be called gods creatures capable of thought whose
aims extend far beyond the satisfaction of their bodily appetites
and personal affections since they perceive that it is only by the
establishment of a social order founded on common bonds of moral faith
that the world can rise from mere savagery But how is this order to be
set up by Godhead in a world of stupid giants since these thoughtless
ones pursue only their narrower personal ends and can by no means
understand the aims of a god Godhead face to face with Stupidity must
compromise Unable to enforce on the world the pure law of thought it
must resort to a mechanical law of commandments to be enforced by
brute punishments and the destruction of the disobedient And however
carefully these laws are framed to represent the highest thoughts of the
framers at the moment of their promulgation before a day has elapsed
that thought has grown and widened by the ceaseless evolution of life
and lo yesterdays law already fallen out with todays thought Yet if
the high givers of that law themselves set the example of breaking
it before it is a week old they destroy all its authority with their
subjects and so break the weapon they have forged to rule them for
their own good They must therefore maintain at all costs the sanctity
of the law even when it has ceased to represent their thought so that
at last they get entangled in a network of ordinances which they no
longer believe in and yet have made so sacred by custom and so terrible
by punishment that they cannot themselves escape from them Thus
Godheads resort to law finally costs it half its integrityas if
a spiritual king to gain temporal power had plucked out one of his
eyesand it finally begins secretly to long for the advent of some
power higher than itself which will destroy its artificial empire of
law and establish a true republic of free thought
This is by no means the only difficulty in the dominion of Law The
brute force for its execution must be purchased and the mass of its
subjects must be persuaded to respect the authority which employs this
force But how is such respect to be implanted in them if they are
unable to comprehend the thought of the lawgiver Clearly only by
associating the legislative power with such displays of splendor and
majesty as will impress their senses and awe their imaginations The god
turned lawgiver in short must be crowned Pontiff and King Since he
cannot be known to the common folk as their superior in wisdom he must
be known to them as their superior in riches as the dweller in castles
the wearer of gold and purple the eater of mighty feasts the commander
of armies and the wielder of powers of life and death of salvation
and damnation after death Something may be done in this way without
corruption whilst the golden age still endures Your gods may not
prevail with the dwarfs but they may go to these honest giants who will
give a days work for a days pay and induce them to build for Godhead
a mighty fortress complete with hall and chapel tower and bell for
the sake of the homesteads that will grow up in security round that
churchcastle This only however whilst the golden age lasts The
moment the Plutonic power is let loose and the loveless Alberic comes
into the field with his corrupting millions the gods are face to face
with destruction since Alberic able with invisible hungerwhip to
force the labor of the dwarfs and to buy the services of the giants
can outshine all the temporal shows and splendors of the golden age
and make himself master of the world unless the gods with their bigger
brains can capture his gold This the dilemma of the Church today
is the situation created by the exploit of Alberic in the depths of the
Rhine
Second Scene
From the bed of the river we rise into cloudy regions and finally come
out into the clear in a meadow where Wotan the god of gods and his
consort Fricka lie sleeping Wotan you will observe has lost one eye
and you will presently learn that he plucked it out voluntarily as the
price to be paid for his alliance with Fricka who in return has brought
to him as her dowry all the powers of Law The meadow is on the brink of
a ravine beyond which towering on distant heights stands Godhome a
mighty castle newly built as a house of state for the oneeyed god and
his allruling wife Wotan has not yet seen this castle except in his
dreams two giants have just built it for him whilst he slept and the
reality is before him for the first time when Fricka wakes him In that
majestic burg he is to rule with her and through her over the humble
giants who have eyes to gape at the glorious castles their own
hands have built from his design but no brains to design castles for
themselves or to comprehend divinity As a god he is to be great
secure and mighty but he is also to be passionless affectionless
wholly impartial for Godhead if it is to live with Law must have no
weaknesses no respect for persons All such sweet littlenesses must be
left to the humble stupid giants to make their toil sweet to them and
the god must after all pay for Olympian power the same price the dwarf
has paid for Plutonic power
Wotan has forgotten this in his dreams of greatness Not so Fricka What
she is thinking of is this price that Wotan has consented to pay
in token whereof he has promised this day to hand over to the giants
Frickas sister the goddess Freia with her golden loveapples When
Fricka reproaches Wotan with having selfishly forgotten this she finds
that he like herself is not prepared to go through with his bargain
and that he is trusting to another great worldforce the Lie a European
Power as Lassalle said to help him to trick the giants out of their
reward But this force does not dwell in Wotan himself but in another
a god over whom he has triumphed one Loki the god of Intellect
Argument Imagination Illusion and Reason Loki has promised to
deliver him from his contract and to cheat the giants for him but he
has not arrived to keep his word indeed as Fricka bitterly points
out why should not the Lie fail Wotan since such failure is the very
essence of him
The giants come soon enough and Freia flies to Wotan for protection
against them Their purposes are quite honest and they have no doubt
of the gods faith There stands their part of the contract fulfilled
stone on stone port and pinnacle all faithfully finished from Wotans
design by their mighty labor They have come undoubtingly for their
agreed wage Then there happens what is to them an incredible
inconceivable thing The god begins to shuffle There are no moments in
life more tragic than those in which the humble common man the manual
worker leaving with implicit trust all high affairs to his betters and
reverencing them wholly as worthy of that trust even to the extent
of accepting as his rightful function the saving of them from all
roughening and coarsening drudgeries first discovers that they are
corrupt greedy unjust and treacherous The shock drives a ray of
