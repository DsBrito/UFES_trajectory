Memoirs whence Alexandre Dumas culled it that he might turn it to
such excellent romantic account In La Rochefoucaulds narrative it is
the painter Gerbier who in a far less heroic manner plays the part
assigned by Dumas to dArtagnan and it is the Countess of Carlisle who
carries out the political theft which Dumas attributes to Milady For
the rest I do not invite you to attach undue credit to it which is
not however to say that I account it wholly false
In the case of The Hermosa Fembra I confess to having blended
together into one single narrative two historical episodes closely
connected in time and place Susans daughter was in fact herself the
betrayer of her father and it was in penitence for that unnatural act
that she desired her skull to be exhibited as I describe Into the story
of Susans daughter I have woven that of another NewChristian girl
who like the Hermosa Fembra her taken a Castilian loverin this case
a youth of the house of Guzman This youth was driven into concealment
in circumstances more or less as I describe them He overheard the
judaizing of several NewChristians there assembled and bore word of it
at once to Ojeda The two episodes were separated in fact by an interval
of three years and the first afforded Ojeda a strong argument for the
institution of the Holy Office in Seville Between the two there are
many points of contact and each supplies what the other lacks to make
an interesting narrative having for background the introduction of the
Inquisition to Castile The denouement I supply is entirely fictitious
and the introduction of Torquemada is quite arbitrary Ojeda was the
inquisitor who dealt with both cases But if there I stray into fiction
at least I claim to have sketched a faithful portrait of the Grand
Inquisitor as I know him from fairly exhaustive researches into his life
and times
The story of the False Demetrius is here related from the point of view
of my adopted solution of what is generally regarded as a historical
mystery The mystery lies of course in the mans identity He has
been held by some to have been the unfrocked monk Grishka Otropiev by
others to have been a son of Stephen Bathory King of Poland I am not
aware that the theory that he was both at one and the same time has ever
been put forward and whilst admitting that it is speculative yet I
claim that no other would appear so aptly to fit all the known facts of
his career or to shed light upon its mysteries
Undoubtedly I have allowed myself a good deal of licence and speculation
in treating certain unwitnessed scenes in The Barren Wooing But
the theory that I develop in it to account for the miscarriage of the
matrimonial plans of Queen Elizabeth and Robert Dudley seems to me to
be not only very fully warranted by de Quadras correspondence but the
only theory that will convincingly explain the events Elizabeth as
I show was widely believed to be an accessory to the murder of Amy
Robsart But in carefully following her words and actions at that
critical time as reported by de Quadra my reading of the transaction
is as given here The most damning fact against Elizabeth was held to be
her own statement to de Quadra on the eve of Lady Robert Dudleys murder
to the effect that Lady Robert was already dead or very nearly
so This foreknowledge of the fate of that unfortunate lady has been
accepted as positive evidence that the Queen was a party to the crime at
Cumnor which was to set her lover free to marry again Far from that
however I account it positive proof of Elizabeths innocence of any
such part in the deed Elizabeth was far too crafty and clearsighted
not to realize how her words must incriminate her afterwards if she knew
that the murder of Lady Robert was projected She must have been merely
repeating what Dudley himself had told her and what he must have told
herand she believedwas that his wife was at the point of a natural
death Similarly Dudley would not have told her this unless his aim
had been to procure his wifes removal by means which would admit of
a natural interpretation Difficulties encountered much as I relate
themand for which there is abundant evidencedrove his toozealous
agents to rather desperate lengths and thus brought suspicion not only
upon the guilty Dudley but also upon the innocent Queen The manner
of Amys murder is pure conjecture but it should not be far from what
actually took place The possibility of an accidentextraordinarily and
suspiciously opportune for Dudley as it would have beencould not be
altogether ruled out but for the further circumstance that Lady
Robert had removed everybody from Cumnor on that day To what can
this pointunless we accept an altogether incredible chain of
coincidencebut to some such plotting as I here suggest
In the remaining six essays in this volume the liberties taken with the
absolute facts are so slight as to require no apology or comment

I THE ABSOLUTION
Aftonso Henriques first King of Portugal
In 1093 the Moors of the Almoravide dynasty under the Caliph Yusuf
swept irresistibly upwards into the Iberian Peninsula recapturing
Lisbon and Santarem in the west and pushing their conquest as far as
the river Mondego
To meet this revival of Mohammedan power Alfonso VI Of Castile
summoned the chivalry of Christendom to his aid Among the knights who
answered the call was Count Henry of Burgundy grandson of Robert first
Duke of Burgundy to whom Alfonso gave his natural daughter Theresa in
marriage together with the Counties of Oporto and Coimbra with the
title of Count of Portugal
That is the first chapter of the history of Portugal
Count Henry fought hard to defend his southern frontiers from the
incursion of the Moors until his death in 1114 Thereafter his widow
Theresa became Regent of Portugal during the minority of their son
Affonso Henriques A woman of great energy resource and ambition she
successfully waged war against the Moors and in other ways laid the
foundations upon which her son was to build the Kingdom of Portugal But
her passionate infatuation for one of her knightsDon Fernando Peres de
Travaand the excessive honours she bestowed upon him made enemies for
her in the new state and estranged her from her son
In 1127 Alfonso VII of Castile invaded Portugal compelling Theresa
to recognize him as her suzerain But Affonso Henriques now aged
seventeenand declared by the citizens of the capital to be of age and
competent to reignincontinently refused to recognize the submission
made by his mother and in the following year assembled an army for the
purpose of expelling her and her lover from the country The warlike
Theresa resisted until defeated in the battle of San Mamede and taken
prisoner
He was little more than a boy although four years were sped already
since as a mere lad of fourteen he had kept vigil throughout the night
over his arms in the Cathedral of Zamora preparatory to receiving
the honour of knighthood at the hands of his cousin Alfonso VII of
Castile Yet already he was looked upon as the very pattern of what a
Christian knight should be worthy son of the father who had devoted his
life to doing battle against the Infidel wheresoever he might be found
He was wellgrown and tall and of a bodily strength that is almost a
byword to this day in that Portugal of which he was the real founder
and first king He was skilled beyond the common wont in all knightly
exercises of arms and horsemanship and equipped with far more
learningthough much of it was illdigested as this story will serve
to showthan the twelfth century considered useful or even proper in
a knight And he was at least true to his time in that he combined a
fervid piety with a weakness of the flesh and an impetuous arrogance
that was to bring him under the ban of greater excommunication at the
very outset of his reign
It happened that his imprisonment of his mother was not at all pleasing
in the sight of Rome Dona Theresa had powerful friends who so
used their influence at the Vatican on her behalf that the Holy
Fatherconveniently ignoring the provocation she had given and the
scandalous unmotherly conduct of which she had been guiltycame to
consider the behaviour of the Infante of Portugal as reprehensibly
unfilial and commanded him to deliver Dona Theresa at once from duress
This Papal order backed by a threat of excommunication in the event of
disobedience was brought to the young prince by the Bishop of Coimbra
whom he counted among his friends
Affonso Henriques ever impetuous and quick to anger flushed scarlet
when he heard that uncompromising message His dark eyes smouldered as
they considered the aged prelate
You come here to bid me let loose again upon this land of Portugal that
author of strife to deliver over the people once more to the oppression
of the Lord of Trava he asked And you tell me that unless by obeying
this command I am false to the duty I owe this country you will launch
the curse of Rome against me You tell me this
The bishop deeply stirred torn between his duty to the Holy See and
his affection for his prince bowed his head and wrung his hands What
choice have I he asked on a quavering note
I raised you from the dust Thunder was rumbling in the princes
voice Myself I placed the episcopal ring upon your finger
My lord my lord Could I forget All that I have I owe to yousave
only my soul which I owe to God my faith which I owe to Christ and
my obedience which I owe to our Holy Father the Pope
The prince considered him in silence mastering his passionate
impetuous nature Go he growled at last
The prelate bowed his head his eyes not daring to meet his princes
God keep you lord he almost sobbed and so went out
But though stirred by his affection for the prince to whom he owed so
much though knowing in his inmost heart that Affonso Henriques was in
the right the Bishop of Coimbra did not swerve from his duty to Rome
which was as plain as it was unpalatable Betimes next morning word was
brought to Affonso Henriques in the Alcazar of Coimbra that a
parchment was nailed to the door of the Cathedral setting forth his
excommunication and that the Bishopeither out of fear or out of
sorrowhad left the city journeying northward towards Oporto
Affonso Henriques passed swiftly from incredulity to anger then almost
as swiftly came to a resolve which was as mad and harebrained as could
have been expected from a lad in his eighteenth year who held the reins
of power Yet by its very directness and its superb ignoring of all
obstacles legal and canonical it was invested with a certain wild
sanity
In full armour a white cloak simply embroidered in gold at the edge
and knotted at the shoulder he rode to the Cathedral attended by his
halfbrother Pedro Affonso and two of his knights Emigio Moniz and
Sancho Nunes There on the great ironstudded doors he found as he had
been warned the Roman parchment pronouncing him accursed its sonorous
Latin periods set forth in a fine round clerkly hand
He swung down from his great horse and clanked up the Cathedral steps
his attendants following He had for witnesses no more than a few
loiterers who had paused at sight of their prince
The interdict had so far attracted no attention for in the twelfth
century the art of letters was a mystery to which there were few
initiates
Affonso Henriques tore the sheepskin from its nails and crumpled it
in his hand then he passed into the Cathedral and thence came out
presently into the cloisters Overhead a bell was clanging by his
orders summoning the chapter
To the Infante waiting there in the sundrenched close came presently
the canons austere aloof majestic in their unhurried progress through
the fretted cloisters with flowing garments and hands tucked into
their wide sleeves before them In a semicircle they arrayed themselves
before him and waited impassively to learn his will Overhead the bell
had ceased
Affonso Henriques wasted no words
I have summoned you he announced to command that you proceed to the
election of a bishop
A rustle stirred through the priestly throng The canons looked askance
at the prince and at one another Then one of them spoke
Habemus episcopum he said gravely and several instantly made chorus
We have a bishop
The eyes of the young sovereign kindled You are wrong he told them
You had a bishop but he is here no longer He has deserted his see
after publishing this shameful thing And he held aloft the crumpled
interdict As I am a Godfearing Christian knight I will not live
under this ban Since the bishop who excommunicated me is gone you will
at once elect another in his place who shall absolve me
They stood before him silent and impassive in their priestly dignity
and in their assurance that the law was on their side
Well the boy growled at them
Habemus episcopum droned a voice again
Amen boomed in chorus through the cloisters
I tell you that your bishop is gone he insisted his voice quivering
now with anger and I tell you that he shall not return that he shall
never set foot again within my city of Coimbra Proceed you therefore at
once to the election of his successor
Lord he was answered coldly by one of them no such election is
possible or lawful
Do you dare stand before my face and tell me this he roared
infuriated by their cold resistance He flung out an arm in a gesture
of terrible dismissal Out of my sight you proud and evil men Back to
your cells to await my pleasure Since in your arrogant stiffnecked
pride you refuse to do my will you shall receive the bishop I shall
myself select
He was so terrific in his rage that they dared not tell him that he had
no power prince though he might be to make such an election bowed to
him ever impassively and with their hands still folded unhurried as
they had come they now turned and filed past him in departure
He watched them with scowling brows and tightened lips Moniz and Nunes
silent behind him Suddenly those dark watchful eyes of his were held
by the last figure of all in that austere processiona tall gaunt
young man whose coppercoloured skin and hawkfeatured face proclaimed
his Moorish blood Instantly maliciously it flashed through the
princes boyish mind how he might make of this man an instrument to
humble the pride of that insolent clergy He raised his hand and
beckoned the cleric to him
What is your name he asked him
I am called Zuleyman lord he was answered and the name
confirmedwhere indeed no confirmation was necessarythe fellows
Moorish origin
Affonso Henriques laughed It would be an excellent jest to thrust upon
these arrogant priests who refused to appoint a bishop of their choice
a bishop who was little better than a blackamoor
Don Zuleyman said the prince I name you Bishop of Coimbra in the
room of the rebel who has fled You will prepare to celebrate High Mass
this morning and to pronounce my absolution
The Christianized Moor fell back a step his face paling under its
copper skin to a sickly grey In the background the hindmost members of
the retreating clerical procession turned and stood at gaze angered and
scandalized by what they heard which was indeed a thing beyond belief
Ah no my lord Ah no Don Zuleyman was faltering Not that
The prospect terrified him and in his agitation he had recourse to
Latin Domine non sum dignus he cried and beat his breast
But the uncompromising Affonso Henriques gave him back Latin for Latin
DixiI have spoken he answered sternly Do not fail me in
obedience on your life And on that he clanked out again with his
attendants wellpleased with his mornings work
As he had disposed with boyish almost irresponsible rashness and in
flagrant contravention of all canon law so it fell out Don Zuleyman
wearing the bishops robes and the bishops mitre intoned the Kyrie
Eleison before noon that day in the Cathedral of Coimbra and pronounced
the absolution of the Infante of Portugal who knelt so submissively and
devoutly before him
Affonso Henriques was very pleased with himself He made a jest of the
affair and invited his intimates to laugh with him But Emigio Moniz
and the elder members of his council refused to laugh They looked with
awe upon a deed that went perilously near to sacrilege and implored him
to take their own sober view of the thing he had done
By the bones of St James he cried A prince is not to be
browbeaten by a priest
Such a view in the twelfth century was little short of revolutionary
The chapter of the Cathedral of Coimbra held the converse opinion that
priests were not to be browbeaten by a prince and set themselves to
make Affonso Henriques realize this to his bitter cost They dispatched
to Rome an account of his unconscionable highhanded incredible
sacrilege and invited Rome to administer condign spiritual flagellation
upon this errant child of Mother Church Rome made haste to vindicate
her authority and dispatched a legate to the recalcitrant audacious
boy who ruled in Portugal But the distance being considerable and
means of travel inadequate and slow it was not until Don Zuleyman had
presided in the See of Coimbra for a full two months that the Papal
Legate made his appearance in Affonso Henriques capital
A very splendid Prince of the Church was Cardinal Corrado the envoy
dispatched by Pope Honorius II full armed with apostolic weapons to
reduce the rebellious Infante of Portugal into proper subjection
His approach was heralded by the voice of rumour Affonso Henriques
heard of it without perturbation His conscience at ease in the
absolution which he had wrung from Mother Church after his own fashion
he was entirely absorbed in preparations for a campaign against the
Moors which was to widen his dominions Therefore when at length the
thunderbolt descended it fellso far as he was concernedfrom a sky
entirely clear
It was towards dusk of a summer evening when the legate in a litter
slung in line between two mules entered Coimbra He was attended by two
nephews Giannino and Pierluigi da Corrado both patricians of Rome
and a little knot of servants Empanoplied in his sacred office the
cardinal had no need of the protection of menatarms upon a journey
through godfearing lands
He was borne straight to the old Moorish palace where the Infante
resided and came upon him there amid a numerous company in the great
pillared hall Against a background of battle trophies livid weapons
implements of war and suits of mail both Saracen and Christian with
which the bare walls were hung moved a gailyclad courtly gathering of
nobles and their womenfolk when the great cardinal clad from head to
foot in scarlet entered unannounced
Laughter rippled into silence A hush descended upon the company which
stood now at gaze considering the imposing and unbidden guest Slowly
the legate followed by the two Roman youths advanced down the hall
the soft pad of his slippered feet and the rustle of his silken robes
being at first the only sound On he came until he stood before the
shallow dais where in a massively carved chair sat the Infante of
Portugal mistrustfully observing him Affonso Henriques scented here
an enemy an ally of his mothers the bearer of a fresh declaration of
hostilities Therefore of deliberate purpose he kept his seat as if to
stress the fact that here he was the master
Lord Cardinal he greeted the legate be welcome to my land of
Portugal
The cardinal bowed stiffly resentful of this reception In his long
journey across the Spains princes and nobles had flocked to kiss his
hand and bend the knee before him seeking his blessing Yet this
mere boy beardless save for a silky down about his firm young cheeks
retained his seat and greeted him with no more submissiveness than if he
had been the envoy of some temporal prince
I am the representative of our Holy Father he announced in a voice
of stern reproof I am from Rome with these my wellbeloved nephews
From Rome quoth Affonso Henriques For all his length of limb and
massive thews he could be impish upon occasion He was impish now
Although no good has ever yet come to me from Rome you make me
hopeful His Holiness will have heard of the preparations I am making
for a war against the Infidel that shall carry the Cross where new
stands the Crescent and sends me perhaps a gift of gold or assist me
in this holy work
The mockery of it stung the legate sharply His sallow ascetic face
empurpled
It is not gold I bring you he answered but a lesson in the faith
which you would seem to have forgotten I am come to teach you your
Christian duty and to require of you immediate reparation of the
sacrilegious wrongs you have done The Holy Father demands of you the
instant reinstatement of the Bishop of Coimbra whom you have driven
out with threats of violence and the degradation of the cleric you
blasphemously appointed Bishop in his stead
And is that all quoth the boy in a voice dangerously quiet
No Fearless in his sense of right the legate towered before him
It is demanded of you further that you instantly release the lady your
mother from the unjust confinement in which you hold her
That confinement is not unjust as all here can witness the Infante
answered Rome may believe it because lies have been carried to
Rome Dona Theresas life was a scandal her regency an injustice to my
people She and the infamous Lord of Trava lighted the torch of civil
war in these dominions Learn here the truth and carry it to Rome Thus
shall you do worthy service
But the prelate was obstinate and proud
That is not the answer that our Holy Father awaits
It is the answer that I send
Rash rebellious youth beware The cardinals anger flamed up and
his voice swelled I come armed with spiritual weapons of destruction
Do not abuse the patience of Mother Church or you shall feel the full
weight of her wrath released against you
Exasperated Affonso Henriques bounded to his feet his face livid now
with passion his eyes ablaze
Out Away he cried Go my lord and go quickly or as God watches
us I will add here and now yet another sacrilege to those of which you
accuse me
The prelate gathered his ample robes about him If pale he was entirely
calm once more With stern dignity he bowed to the angry youth and
so departed but with such outward impassivity that it would have been
difficult to say with whom lay the victory If Affonso Henriques thought
that night that he had conquered morning was to shatter the illusion
He was awakened early by a chamberlain at the urgent instances of Emigio
Moniz who was demanding immediate audience Affonso Henriques sat up in
bed and bade him to be admitted
The elderly knight and faithful counsellor came in treading heavily
His swarthy face was overcast his mouth set in stern lines under its
grizzled beard
God keep you lord was his greeting so lugubriously delivered as to
sound like a pious but rather hopeless wish
And you Emigio answered him the Infante You are early astir What
is the cause
III tidings lord He crossed the room unlatched and flung wide a
window Listen he bade the prince
On the still morning air arose a sound like the drone of some gigantic
hive or of the sea when the tide is making Affonso Henriques
recognized it for the murmur of the multitude
What does it mean he asked and thrust a sinewy leg from the bed
It means that the Papal Legate has done all that he threatened and
something more He has placed your city of Coimbra under a ban of
excommunication The churches are closed and until the ban is lifted
no priest Will be found to baptize marry shrive or perform any other
Sacrament of Holy Church The people are stricken with terror knowing
that they share the curse with you They are massing below at the gates
of the alcazar demanding to see you that they may implore you to lift
from them the horror of this excommunication
Affonso Henriques had come to his feet by now and he stood there
staring at the old knight his face blenched his stout heart clutched
by fear of these impalpable blasting weapons that were being used
against him
My God he groaned and asked What must I do
Moniz was preternaturally grave It is of the first importance that the
people should be pacified
But how
There is one way onlyby a promise that you will submit to the will
of the Holy Father and by penance seek absolution for yourself and your
city
A red flush swept into the young cheeks that had been so pale
What he cried his voice a roar Release my mother depose Zuleyman
recall that fugitive recreant who cursed me and humble myself to seek
pardon at the hands of this insolent Italian cleric May my bones rot
may I roast for ever in hellfire if I show myself such a craven And
do you counsel it Emigiodo you really counsel that He was in a
towering rage
Listen to that voice Emigio answered him and waved a hand to the
open window How else will you silence it
Affonso Henriques sat down on the edge of the bed and took his head in
his hands He was checkmatedand yet
He rose and beat his hands together summoning chamberlain and pages to
help him dress and arm
Where is the legate lodged he asked Moniz
He is gone the knight answered him He left at cockcrow taking the
road to Spain along the Mondegoso I learnt from the watch at the River
Gate
How came they to open for him
His office lord is a key that opens all doors at any hour of day or
night They dared not detain or delay him
Ha grunted the Infante We will go after him then And he made
haste to complete his dressing Then he buckled on his great sword and
they departed
In the courtyard of the alcazar he summoned Sancho Nunes and a
halfdozen menatarms to attend him mounted a charger and with Emigio
Moniz at his side and the others following he rode out across the
drawbridge into the open space that was thronged with the clamant
inhabitants of the stricken city
A great cry went up when he showed himselfa mighty appeal to him for
mercy and the remission of the curse Then silence fell a silence that
invited him to answer and give comfort
He reined in his horse and standing in his stirrups very tall and
virile he addressed them
People of Coimbra he announced I go to obtain this citys
absolution from the ban that has been laid upon it I shall return
before sunset Till then do you keep the peace
The voice of the multitude was raised again this time to hail him as
the father and protector of the Portuguese and to invoke the blessing
of Heaven upon his handsome head
Riding between Moniz and Nunes and followed by his glittering
menatarms he crossed the city and took the road along the river by
which it was known that the legate had departed All that morning
they rode briskly amain the Infante fasting as he had risen yet
unconscious of hunger and of all else but the purpose that was consuming
him He rode in utter silence his face set his brows stern and Moniz
watching him furtively the while wondered what thoughts were stirring
in that rash impetuous young brain and was afraid
Towards noon at last they overtook the legates party They espied his
mulelitter at the door of an inn in a little village some ten miles
beyond the foothills of the Bussaco range The Infante reined up
sharply a hoarse fierce cry escaping him akin to that of some
creature of the wild when it espies its prey
Moniz put forth a hand to seize his arm
My lord my lord he cried fearfully What is your purpose
The prince looked him between the eyes and his lips curled in a smile
that was not altogether sweet
I am going to beg Cardinal Corrado to have compassion on me he
answered subtly mocking and on that he swung down from his horse and
tossed the reins to a manatarms
Into the inn he clanked Moniz and Nunes following closely He thrust
aside the vinter who not knowing him would have hindered him great
lord though he seemed from disturbing the holy guest who was honouring
the house He strode on and into the room where the Cardinal with his
noble nephews sat at dinner
At sight of him fearing violence Giannino and Pierluigi came instantly
to their feet their hands upon their daggers But Cardinal da Corrado
sat unmoved He looked up a smile of ineffable gentleness upon his
ascetic face
I had hoped that you would come after me my son he said If you
come a penitent then has my prayer been heard
A penitent cried Affonso Henriques He laughed wickedly and plucked
his dagger from its sheath
Sancho Nunes in terror set a detaining hand upon his princes arm
My lord he cried in a voice that shook you will not strike the
Lords anointedthat were to destroy yourself for ever
A curse said Affonso Henriques perishes with him that uttered it
He could reason loosely you see this hotblooded impetuous young
cutter of Gordian knots And it imports above all else that the curse
should be lifted from my city of Coimbra
It shall be my son as soon as you show penitence and a Christian
