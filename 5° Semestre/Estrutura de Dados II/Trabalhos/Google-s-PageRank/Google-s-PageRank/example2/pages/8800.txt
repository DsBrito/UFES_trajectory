CANTO I
His glory by whose might all things are movd
Pierces the universe and in one part
Sheds more resplendence elsewhere less  In heavn
That largeliest of his light partakes was I
Witness of things which to relate again
Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence
For that so near approaching its desire
Our intellect is to such depth absorbd
That memory cannot follow  Nathless all
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
Could store shall now be matter of my song
Benign Apollo this last labour aid
And make me such a vessel of thy worth
As thy own laurel claims of me belovd
Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus brows
Sufficd me henceforth there is need of both
For my remaining enterprise Do thou
Enter into my bosom and there breathe
So as when Marsyas by thy hand was draggd
Forth from his limbs unsheathd  O power divine
If thou to me of shine impart so much
That of that happy realm the shadowd form
Tracd in my thoughts I may set forth to view
Thou shalt behold me of thy favourd tree
Come to the foot and crown myself with leaves
For to that honour thou and my high theme
Will fit me  If but seldom mighty Sire
To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
Caesar or bard more shame for human wills
Depravd joy to the Delphic god must spring
From the Pierian foliage when one breast
Is with such thirst inspird  From a small spark
Great flame hath risen after me perchance
Others with better voice may pray and gain
From the Cirrhaean city answer kind
Through diver passages the worlds bright lamp
Rises to mortals but through that which joins
Four circles with the threefold cross in best
Course and in happiest constellation set
He comes and to the worldly wax best gives
Its temper and impression  Morning there
Here eve was by almost such passage made
And whiteness had oerspread that hemisphere
Blackness the other part when to the left
I saw Beatrice turnd and on the sun
Gazing as never eagle fixd his ken
As from the first a second beam is wont
To issue and reflected upwards rise
Een as a pilgrim bent on his return
So of her act that through the eyesight passd
Into my fancy mine was formd and straight
Beyond our mortal wont I fixd mine eyes
Upon the sun  Much is allowed us there
That here exceeds our powr thanks to the place
Made for the dwelling of the human kind
I sufferd it not long and yet so long
That I beheld it bickring sparks around
As iron that comes boiling from the fire
And suddenly upon the day appeard
A day newrisn as he who hath the power
Had with another sun bedeckd the sky
Her eyes fast fixd on the eternal wheels
Beatrice stood unmovd and I with ken
Fixd upon her from upward gaze removd
At her aspect such inwardly became
As Glaucus when he tasted of the herb
That made him peer among the ocean gods
Words may not tell of that transhuman change
And therefore let the example serve though weak
For those whom grace hath better proof in store
If I were only what thou didst create
Then newly Love by whom the heavn is ruld
Thou knowst who by thy light didst bear me up
Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide
Desired Spirit with its harmony
Temperd of thee and measurd charmd mine ear
Then seemd to me so much of heavn to blaze
With the suns flame that rain or flood neer made
A lake so broad  The newness of the sound
And that great light inflamd me with desire
Keener than eer was felt to know their cause
Whence she who saw me clearly as myself
To calm my troubled mind before I askd
Opend her lips and gracious thus began
With false imagination thou thyself
Makst dull so that thou seest not the thing
Which thou hadst seen had that been shaken off
Thou art not on the earth as thou believst
For lightning scapd from its own proper place
Neer ran as thou hast hither now returnd
Although divested of my firstraisd doubt
By those brief words accompanied with smiles
Yet in new doubt was I entangled more
And said Already satisfied I rest
From admiration deep but now admire
How I above those lighter bodies rise
Whence after uttrance of a piteous sigh
She towrds me bent her eyes with such a look
As on her frenzied child a mother casts
Then thus began Among themselves all things
Have order and from hence the form which makes
The universe resemble God  In this
The higher creatures see the printed steps
Of that eternal worth which is the end
Whither the line is drawn  All natures lean
In this their order diversely some more
Some less approaching to their primal source
Thus they to different havens are movd on
Through the vast sea of being and each one
With instinct givn that bears it in its course
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire
This prompts the hearts of mortal animals
This the brute earth together knits and binds
Nor only creatures void of intellect
Are aimd at by this bow but even those
That have intelligence and love are piercd
That Providence who so well orders all
With her own light makes ever calm the heaven
In which the substance that hath greatest speed
Is turnd and thither now as to our seat
Predestind we are carried by the force
Of that strong cord that never looses dart
But at fair aim and glad  Yet is it true
That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
To the design of art through sluggishness
Of unreplying matter so this course
Is sometimes quitted by the creature who
Hath power directed thus to bend elsewhere
As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall
From its original impulse warpd to earth
By vicious fondness  Thou no more admire
Thy soaring if I rightly deem than lapse
Of torrent downwards from a mountains height
There would in thee for wonder be more cause
If free of hindrance thou hadst fixd thyself
Below like fire unmoving on the earth
So said she turnd toward the heavn her face
CANTO II
All ye who in small bark have following saild
Eager to listen on the adventrous track
Of my proud keel that singing cuts its way
Backward return with speed and your own shores
Revisit nor put out to open sea
Where losing me perchance ye may remain
Bewilderd in deep maze  The way I pass
Neer yet was run Minerva breathes the gale
Apollo guides me and another Nine
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal
Ye other few who have outstretchd the neck
Timely for food of angels on which here
They live yet never know satiety
Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out
Your vessel marking well the furrow broad
Before you in the wave that on both sides
Equal returns  Those glorious who passd oer
To Colchos wonderd not as ye will do
When they saw Jason following the plough
The increate perpetual thirst that draws
Toward the realm of Gods own form bore us
Swift almost as the heaven ye behold
Beatrice upward gazd and I on her
And in such space as on the notch a dart
Is placd then loosend flies I saw myself
Arrivd where wondrous thing engagd my sight
Whence she to whom no work of mine was hid
Turning to me with aspect glad as fair
Bespake me Gratefully direct thy mind
To God through whom to this first star we come
Me seemd as if a cloud had coverd us
Translucent solid firm and polishd bright
Like adamant which the suns beam had smit
Within itself the everduring pearl
Receivd us as the wave a ray of light
Receives and rests unbroken  If I then
Was of corporeal frame and it transcend
Our weaker thought how one dimension thus
Another could endure which needs must be
If body enter body how much more
Must the desire inflame us to behold
That essence which discovers by what means
God and our nature joind  There will be seen
That which we hold through faith not shown by proof
But in itself intelligibly plain
Een as the truth that man at first believes
I answered Lady I with thoughts devout
Such as I best can frame give thanks to Him
Who hath removd me from the mortal world
But tell I pray thee whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint
She somewhat smild then spake If mortals err
In their opinion when the key of sense
Unlocks not surely wonders weapon keen
Ought not to pierce thee since thou findst the wings
Of reason to pursue the senses flight
Are short  But what thy own thought is declare
Then I What various here above appears
Is causd I deem by bodies dense or rare
She then resumd Thou certainly wilt see
In falsehood thy belief oerwhelmd if well
Thou listen to the arguments which I
Shall bring to face it  The eighth sphere displays
Numberless lights the which in kind and size
May be remarkd of different aspects
If rare or dense of that were cause alone
One single virtue then would be in all
Alike distributed or more or less
Different virtues needs must be the fruits
Of formal principles and these save one
Will by thy reasoning be destroyd  Beside
If rarity were of that dusk the cause
Which thou inquirest either in some part
That planet must throughout be void nor fed
With its own matter or as bodies share
Their fat and leanness in like manner this
Must in its volume change the leaves  The first
If it were true had through the suns eclipse
Been manifested by transparency
Of light as through aught rare beside effusd
But this is not  Therefore remains to see
The other cause and if the other fall
Erroneous so must prove what seemd to thee
If not from side to side this rarity
Pass through there needs must be a limit whence
Its contrary no further lets it pass
And hence the beam that from without proceeds
Must be pourd back as colour comes through glass
Reflected which behind it lead conceals
Now wilt thou say that there of murkier hue
Than in the other part the ray is shown
By being thence refracted farther back
From this perplexity will free thee soon
Experience if thereof thou trial make
The fountain whence your arts derive their streame
Three mirrors shalt thou take and two remove
From thee alike and more remote the third
Betwixt the former pair shall meet thine eyes
Then turnd toward them cause behind thy back
A light to stand that on the three shall shine
And thus reflected come to thee from all
Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
A space so ample yet in brightness thou
Will own it equaling the rest  But now
As under snow the ground if the warm ray
Smites it remains dismantled of the hue
And cold that coverd it before so thee
Dismantled in thy mind I will inform
With light so lively that the tremulous beam
Shall quiver where it falls  Within the heaven
Where peace divine inhabits circles round
A body in whose virtue dies the being
Of all that it contains  The following heaven
That hath so many lights this being divides
Through  different essences from it distinct
And yet containd within it  The other orbs
Their separate distinctions variously
Dispose for their own seed and produce apt
Thus do these organs of the world proceed
As thou beholdest now from step to step
Their influences from above deriving
And thence transmitting downwards  Mark me well
How through this passage to the truth I ford
The truth thou lovst that thou henceforth alone
Mayst know to keep the shallows safe untold
The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs
As mallet by the workmans hand must needs
By blessed movers be inspird  This heaven
Made beauteous by so many luminaries
From the deep spirit that moves its circling sphere
Its image takes an impress as a seal
And as the soul that dwells within your dust
Through members different yet together formd
In different powrs resolves itself een so
The intellectual efficacy unfolds
Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars
On its own unity revolving still
Different virtue compact different
Makes with the precious body it enlivens
With which it knits as life in you is knit
From its original nature full of joy
The virtue mingled through the body shines
As joy through pupil of the living eye
From hence proceeds that which from light to light
Seems different and not from dense or rare
This is the formal cause that generates
Proportiond to its power the dusk or clear
CANTO III
That sun which erst with love my bosom warmd
Had of fair truth unveild the sweet aspect
By proof of right and of the false reproof
And I to own myself convincd and free
Of doubt as much as needed raisd my head
Erect for speech  But soon a sight appeard
Which so intent to mark it held me fixd
That of confession I no longer thought
As through translucent and smooth glass or wave
Clear and unmovd and flowing not so deep
As that its bed is dark the shape returns
So faint of our impicturd lineaments
That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
Comes to the eye such saw I many a face
All stretchd to speak from whence I straight conceivd
Delusion opposite to that which raisd
Between the man and fountain amorous flame
Sudden as I perceivd them deeming these
Reflected semblances to see of whom
They were I turnd mine eyes and nothing saw
Then turnd them back directed on the light
Of my sweet guide who smiling shot forth beams
From her celestial eyes  Wonder not thou
She cryd at this my smiling when I see
Thy childish judgment since not yet on truth
It rests the foot but as it still is wont
Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy
True substances are these which thou beholdst
Hither through failure of their vow exild
But speak thou with them listen and believe
That the true light which fills them with desire
Permits not from its beams their feet to stray
Straight to the shadow which for converse seemd
Most earnest I addressed me and began
As one by overeagerness perplexd
O spirit born for joy who in the rays
Of life eternal of that sweetness knowst
The flavour which not tasted passes far
All apprehension me it well would please
If thou wouldst tell me of thy name and this
Your station here Whence she with kindness prompt
And eyes glistning with smiles Our charity
To any wish by justice introducd
Bars not the door no more than she above
Who would have all her court be like herself
I was a virgin sister in the earth
And if thy mind observe me well this form
With such addition gracd of loveliness
Will not conceal me long but thou wilt know
Piccarda in the tardiest sphere thus placd
Here mid these other blessed also blest
Our hearts whose high affections burn alone
With pleasure from the Holy Spirit conceivd
Admitted to his order dwell in joy
And this condition which appears so low
Is for this cause assignd us that our vows
Were in some part neglected and made void
Whence I to her replied Something divine
Beams in your countenance wondrous fair
From former knowledge quite transmuting you
Therefore to recollect was I so slow
But what thou sayst hath to my memory
Given now such aid that to retrace your forms
Is easier  Yet inform me ye who here
Are happy long ye for a higher place
More to behold and more in love to dwell
She with those other spirits gently smild
Then answerd with such gladness that she seemd
With loves first flame to glow Brother our will
Is in composure settled by the power
Of charity who makes us will alone
What we possess and nought beyond desire
If we should wish to be exalted more
Then must our wishes jar with the high will
Of him who sets us here which in these orbs
Thou wilt confess not possible if here
To be in charity must needs befall
And if her nature well thou contemplate
Rather it is inherent in this state
Of blessedness to keep ourselves within
The divine will by which our wills with his
Are one  So that as we from step to step
Are placd throughout this kingdom pleases all
Een as our King who in us plants his will
And in his will is our tranquillity
It is the mighty ocean whither tends
Whatever it creates and nature makes
Then saw I clearly how each spot in heavn
Is Paradise though with like gracious dew
The supreme virtue showr not over all
But as it chances if one sort of food
Hath satiated and of another still
The appetite remains that this is askd
And thanks for that returnd een so did I
In word and motion bent from her to learn
What web it was through which she had not drawn
The shuttle to its point  She thus began
Exalted worth and perfectness of life
The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven
By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
The robe and veil they wear to that intent
That een till death they may keep watch or sleep
With their great bridegroom who accepts each vow
Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms
from the world to follow her when young
Escapd and in her vesture mantling me
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins
Thereafter men for ill than good more apt
Forth snatchd me from the pleasant cloisters pale
God knows how after that my life was framd
This other splendid shape which thou beholdst
At my right side burning with all the light
Of this our orb what of myself I tell
May to herself apply  From her like me
A sister with like violence were torn
The saintly folds that shaded her fair brows
Een when she to the world again was brought
In spite of her own will and better wont
Yet not for that the bosoms inward veil
Did she renounce  This is the luminary
Of mighty Constance who from that loud blast
Which blew the second over Suabias realm
That power producd which was the third and last
She ceasd from further talk and then began
Ave Maria singing and with that song
Vanishd as heavy substance through deep wave
Mine eye that far as it was capable
Pursued her when in dimness she was lost
Turnd to the mark where greater want impelld
And bent on Beatrice all its gaze
But she as lightning beamd upon my looks
So that the sight sustaind it not at first
Whence I to question her became less prompt
CANTO IV
Between two kinds of food both equally
Remote and tempting first a man might die
Of hunger ere he one could freely choose
Een so would stand a lamb between the maw
Of two fierce wolves in dread of both alike
Een so between two deer a dog would stand
Wherefore if I was silent fault nor praise
I to myself impute by equal doubts
Held in suspense since of necessity
It happend  Silent was I yet desire
Was painted in my looks and thus I spake
My wish more earnestly than language could
As Daniel when the haughty king he freed
From ire that spurrd him on to deeds unjust
And violent so lookd Beatrice then
Well I discern she thus her words addressd
How contrary desires each way constrain thee
So that thy anxious thought is in itself
Bound up and stifled nor breathes freely forth
Thou arguest if the good intent remain
What reason that anothers violence
Should stint the measure of my fair desert
Cause too thou findst for doubt in that it seems
That spirits to the stars as Plato deemd
Return  These are the questions which thy will
Urge equally and therefore I the first
Of that will treat which hath the more of gall
Of seraphim he who is most enskyd
Moses and Samuel and either John
Choose which thou wilt nor even Marys self
Have not in any other heavn their seats
Than have those spirits which so late thou sawst
Nor more or fewer years exist but all
Make the first circle beauteous diversely
Partaking of sweet life as more or less
Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them
Here were they shown thee not that fate assigns
This for their sphere but for a sign to thee
Of that celestial furthest from the height
Thus needs that ye may apprehend we speak
Since from things sensible alone ye learn
That which digested rightly after turns
To intellectual  For no other cause
The scripture condescending graciously
To your perception hands and feet to God
Attributes nor so means and holy church
Doth represent with human countenance
Gabriel and Michael and him who made
Tobias whole  Unlike what here thou seest
The judgment of Timaeus who affirms
Each soul restord to its particular star
Believing it to have been taken thence
When nature gave it to inform her mold
Since to appearance his intention is
Een what his words declare or else to shun
Derision haply thus he hath disguisd
His true opinion  If his meaning be
That to the influencing of these orbs revert
The honour and the blame in human acts
Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth
This principle not understood aright
Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world
So that it fell to fabled names of Jove
And Mercury and Mars  That other doubt
Which moves thee is less harmful for it brings
No peril of removing thee from me
That to the eye of man our justice seems
Unjust is argument for faith and not
For heretic declension  To the end
This truth may stand more clearly in your view
I will content thee even to thy wish
If violence be when that which suffers nought
Consents to that which forceth not for this
These spirits stood exculpate  For the will
That will not still survives unquenchd and doth
