IHE INTRODUCES HIMSELF
In less refined circles than ours I said to Myra your behaviour
would be described as swank Really to judge from the airs you put on
you might be the childs mother
Hes jealous because hes not an aunt himself Isnt he ducksey
darling
I do wish you wouldnt keep dragging the baby into the conversation we
can make it go quite well as a duologue As to being jealouswhy its
absurd True Im not an aunt but in a very short time I shall be an
uncle by marriage which sounds to me much superior That is I added
if youre still equal to it
Myra blew me a kiss over the cradle
Another thing youve forgotten I went on is that Im down for a
place as a godfather Archie tells me that it isnt settled yet but
that theres a good deal of talk about it in the clubs Whos the other
going to be Not Thomas I suppose That would be making the thing
rather a farce
Hasnt Dahlia broken it to you said Myra anxiously
Simpson I asked in an awed whisper
Myra nodded And of course Thomas she said
Heavens Not three of us What a jolly crowd we shall be Thomas can
play our best ball We might
But of course there are only going to be two godfathers she said and
leant over the cradle again
I held up my three end fingers Thomas I said pointing to the
smallest me I explained pointing to the next and Simpson the
tall gentleman in glasses One two three
Oh baby sighed Myra what a very slow uncle by marriage youre
going to have
I stood and gazed at my three fingers for some time
Ive got it I said at last and I pulled down the middle one The
rumour in the clubs was unauthorized I dont get a place after all
Dont say you mind pleaded Myra You see Dahlia thought that as
you were practically one of the family already an uncleelect by
marriage and as she didnt want to choose between Thomas and
Samuel
Say no more I was only afraid that she might have something against my
moral character Child I went on rising and addressing the
unresponsive infant England has lost a godfather this day but the
world has gained awhat I dont know I want my tea
Myra gave the baby a last kiss and got up
Can I trust him with you while I go and see about Dahlia
Im not sure It depends how I feel I may change him with some poor
baby in the village Run away aunt and leave us men to ourselves We
have several matters to discuss
When the child and I were alone together I knelt by his cradle and
surveyed his features earnestly I wanted to see what it was he had to
offer Myra which I could not give her This I said to myself is the
face which has come between her and me for it was unfortunately true
that I could no longer claim Myras undivided attention But the more I
looked at him the more mysterious the whole thing became to me
Not a bad kid said a voice behind me
I turned and saw Archie
Yours I believe I said and I waved him to the cradle
Archie bent down and tickled the babys chin making appropriate noises
the whileone of the things a father has to learn to do
Who do you think hes like he asked proudly
The late Mr Gladstone I said after deep thought
Wrong Hallo heres Dahlia coming out I hope for your sake that the
babys all right If she finds hes caught measles or anything youll
get into trouble
By a stroke of bad luck the child began to cry as soon as he saw the
ladies Myra rushed up to him
Poor little darling she said soothingly Did his uncle by marriage
frighten him then
Dont listen to her Dahlia I said I havent done anything to him
We were chatting together quite amicably until he suddenly caught sight
of Myra and burst into tears
Hes got a little pain said Dahlia gently taking him up and patting
him
I think the trouble is mental suggested Archie He looks to me as if
he had something on his conscience Did he say anything to you about it
when you were alone
He didnt say much I confessed but he seemed to be keeping
something back I think he wants a bit of a run really
Poor little lamb said Dahlia There hes better now thank you
She looked up at Archie and me I dont believe you two love him a
bit
Archie smiled at his wife and went over to the teatable to pour out I
sat on the grass and tried to analyse my feelings to my nephew by
marriage
As an acquaintance I said he is charming I know no one who is
better company If I cannot speak of his more solid qualities it is
only because I do not know him well enough But to say whether I love
him or not is difficult I could tell you better after our first
quarrel However there is one thing I must confess I am rather jealous
of him
You envy his life of idleness
No I envy him the amount of attention he gets from Myra The love she
wastes on him which might be better employed on me is a heartrending
thing to witness As her betrothed I should expect to occupy the premier
place in her affections but really I sometimes think that if the baby
and I both fell into the sea she would jump in and save the baby first
Dont talk about his falling into the sea said Dahlia with a
shudder I cant abear it
I think it will be all right said Archie I was touching wood all
the time
What a silly godfather he nearly had whispered Myra at the cradle
It quite makes you smile doesnt it baby Oh Dahlia hes just like
Archie when he smiles
Oh yes hes the living image of Archie said Dahlia confidently
I looked closely at Archie and then at the baby
I should always know them apart I said at last That and I pointed
to the one at the teatable is Archie and this and I pointed to the
one in the cradle is the baby But then Ive such a wonderful memory
for faces
Baby said Myra Im afraid youre going to know some very foolish
people
IIHE MEETS HIS GODFATHERS
Thomas and Simpson arrived by the twelvethirty train and Myra and I
drove down in the wagonette to meet them Myra handled the ribbons
handled the ribbonswe must have that again while I sat on the
boxseat and pointed out any tractionengines and things in the road I
am very good at this
I suppose I said there will be some sort of ceremony at the
station The stationmaster will read an address while his little
daughter presents a bouquet of flowers You dont often get two
godfathers travelling by the same train Look out I said as we swung
round a corner theres an ant coming
What did you say Im so sorry but I listen awfully badly when Im
driving
As soon as I hit upon anything really good Ill write it down So far I
have been throwing off the merest trifles When we are married
Myra
Go on I love that
When we are married we shant be able to afford horses so well keep a
couple of bicycles and youll be able to hear everything I say How
jolly for you
All right said Myra quietly
There was no formal ceremony on the platform but I did not seem to feel
the want of it when I saw Simpson stepping from the train with an
enormous Teddybear under his arm
Hallo dear old chap he said here we are Youre looking at my
bear I quite forgot it until Id strapped up my bags so I had to bring
it like this It squeaks he added as if that explained it Listen
and the piercing roar of the bear resounded through the station
Very fine Hallo Thomas
Hallo said Thomas and went to look after his luggage
I hope hell like it Simpson went on Its legs move up and down He
put them into several positions and then squeaked it again Jolly
isnt it
Ripping I agreed Whos it for
He looked at me in astonishment for a moment
My dear old chap for the baby
Oh I see Thats awfully nice of you Hell love it I wondered if
Simpson had ever seen a monthold baby Whats its name
Ive been calling it Duncan in the train but of course he will want
to choose his own name for it
Well you must talk it over with him tonight after the ladies have
gone to bed How about your luggage We mustnt keep Myra waiting
Hallo Thomas said Myra as we came out Hallo Samuel Hooray
Hallo Myra said Thomas All right
Myra this is Duncan said Simpson and the shrill roar of the bear
rang out once more
Myra her mouth firm but smiles in her eyes looked down lovingly at
him Sometimes I think that she would like to be Simpsons mother
Perhaps when we are married we might adopt him
For baby she said stroking it with her whip But he wont be
allowed to take it into church with him you know No Thomas I wont
have the luggage next to me I want some one to talk to You come
Inside the wagonette Simpson squeaked his bear at intervals while I
tried to prepare him for his coming introduction to his godson Having
known the baby for nearly a week and being to some extent in Myras
confidence I felt quite the family man beside Simpson
You must try not to be disappointed with his looks I said Anyway
dont let Dahlia think you are And if you want to do the right thing
say that hes just like Archie Archie doesnt mind this for some
reason
Is he tall for his age
Samuel pull yourself together He isnt tall at all If he is anything
he is long but how long only those can say who have seen him in his
bath You do realize that he is only a month old
My dear old boy of course One cant expect much from him I suppose
he isnt even toddling about yet
Nono Not actually toddling
Well we can teach him later on And Im going to have a lot of fun
with him I shall show him my watchbabies always love that
There was a sudden laugh from the front which changed just a little too
late into a cough The fact is I had bet Myra a new golfball that
Simpson would show the baby his watch within two minutes of meeting him
Of course it wasnt a certainty yet but I thought there would be no
harm in mentioning the make of ball I preferred So I changed the
conversation subtly to golf
Amidst loud roars from the bear we drove up to the house and were
greeted by Archie
Hallo Thomas how are you Hallo Simpson Good heavens I know that
face Introduce me Samuel
This is Duncan I brought him down for your boy to play with
Duncan of course The boy will love it Hes tired of me already He
proposes to meet his godfathers at four pm precisely So youll have
nearly three hours to think of something genial to say to him
We spent the last of the three hours playing tennis and at four pm
precisely the introduction took place By great good luck Duncan was
absent Simpson would have wasted his whole two minutes in making it
squeak
Baby said Dahlia this is your Uncle Thomas
Hallo said Thomas gently kissing the babys hand Good old boy
and he felt for his pipe
Baby said Dahlia this is your Uncle Samuel
As he leant over the child I whipped out my watch and murmured Go 4
hrs 1 min 25 sec I wished Myra had not taken my two minutes so
literally but I felt that the golfball was safe
Simpson looked at the baby as if fascinated and the baby stared back at
him It was a new experience for both of them
Hes just like Archie he said at last remembering my advice Only
smaller he added
4 hrs 2 min 7 sec
I can see you baby he said Googoo
Myra came and rested her chin on my shoulder Silently I pointed to the
finishing place on my watch and she gave a little gurgle of excitement
There was only one minute left
I wonder what youre thinking about said Simpson to the baby Is it
my glasses you want to play with
Help I murmured This will never do
He just looks and looks Ah but his Uncle Samuel knows what baby wants
to see I squeezed Myras arm 4 hrs 3 mins 10 secs There was just
time I wonder if its anything in his uncles waistcoat
No whispered Myra to me in agony Certainly not
He shall see it if he wants to said Simpson soothingly and put his
hand to his waistcoat pocket I smiled triumphantly at Myra He had five
seconds to get the watch outplenty of time
Bother said Simpson I left it upstairs
IIIHE CHOOSES A NAME
The afternoon being wet we gathered round the billiardroom fire and
went into committee
The question before the House said Archie is what shall the baby be
called and why Dahlia and I have practically decided on his names but
it would amuse us to hear your inferior suggestions and point out how
ridiculous they are
Godfather Simpson looked across in amazement at Godfather Thomas
Really you are taking a good deal upon yourself Archie he said
coldly It is entirely a matter for my colleague and myself to decide
whether the ground is fit forto decide I should say what the child
is to be called Unless this is quite understood we shall hand in our
resignations
Weve been giving a lot of thought to it said Thomas opening his
eyes for a moment And our time is valuable He arranged the cushions
at his back and closed his eyes again
Well as a matter of fact the competition isnt quite closed said
Archie Entries can still be received
We havent really decided at all put in Dahlia gently It is so
difficult
In that case said Samuel Thomas and I will continue to act It is
my pleasant duty to inform you that we had a long consultation
yesterday and finally agreed to call himerSamuel Thomas
Thomas Samuel said Thomas sleepily
How did you think of those names I asked It must have taken you a
tremendous time
With a name like Samuel Thomas Mannering went on Simpson Thomas
Samuel Mannering murmured Thomas your child might achieve almost
anything In private life you would probably call him Sam
Tom said a tired voice
Or more familiarly Sammy
Tommy came in a whisper from the sofa
What do you think of it asked Dahlia
I mustnt say said Archie theyre my guests But Ill tell you
privately some time
There was silence for a little and then a thought occurred to me
You know Archie I said limited as their ideas are youre rather
in their power Because I was looking through the service in church on
Sunday and there comes a point when the clergyman says to the
godfathers Name this child Well there you are you know Theyve
got you You may have fixed on Montmorency Plantagenet but theyve only
to say Bert and the thing is done
You all forget said Myra coming over to sit on the arm of my chair
that theres a godmother too I shall forbid the Berts
Well that makes it worse Youll have Myra saying Montmorency
Plantagenet and Samuel saying Samuel Thomas and Thomas saying
Thomas Samuel
It will sound rather well said Archie singing it over to himself
Thomas you take the tenor part of course Thomas Samuel Thomas
Samuel Thomas Samuel We must have a rehearsal
For five minutes Myra Thomas and Simpson chanted in harmony being
assisted after the first minute by Archie who took the alto part of
Solomon Joel He explained that as this was what he and his wife
really wanted the child christened Montmorency Plantagenet being only
an invention of the godmothers it would probably be necessary for him
to join in too
Stop cried Dahlia when she could bear it no longer youll wake
baby
There was an immediate hush
Samuel said Archie in a whisper if you wake the baby Ill kill
you
The question of his name was still not quite settled and once more we
gave ourselves up to thought
Seeing that hes the very newest little Rabbit said Myra I do think
he might be called after some very great cricketer
That was the idea in christening him Samuel said Archie
Gaukrodger Carkeek Butt Bajana Mannering I suggestedsomething like
that
Silly I meant Charles after Fry
Schofield after Haigh murmured Thomas
Warren after Bardsley would be more appropriate to a Rabbit said
Simpson beaming round at us There was however no laughter We had
all just thought of it ourselves
The important thing in christening a future firstclass cricketer
said Simpson is to get the initials right What could be better than
W G as a nickname for Grace But if W Gs initials had been Z
Z where would you have been
Here said Archie
The shock of this reply so upset Simpson that his glasses fell off He
picked them out of the fender and resumed his theme
Now if the baby were christened Samuel Thomas his initials would be
S T which are perfect And the same as Coleridges
Is that Coleridge the wicketkeeper or the fast bowler
Simpson opened his mouth to explain and then just in time decided not
to
I forgot to say said Archie that anyhow hes going to be called
Blair after his mamma
If his names Blair Mannering I said at once hell have to write a
book You cant waste a name like that The Crimson Spot by Blair
Mannering Mr Blair Mannering the wellknown author of The Gash Our
new serial The Stain on the Bath Mat has been specially written for
us by Mr and Mrs Blair Mannering Its simply asking for it
Dont talk about his wife yet please smiled Dahlia Let me have him
a little while
Well he can be a writer and a cricketer Why not There are others
I need only mention my friend S Simpson
But the darling still wants another name said Myra Lets call him
John today and William tomorrow and Henry the next day and so on
until we find out what suits him best
Lets all go upstairs now and call him Samuel said Samuel
Thomas said Thomas
We looked at Dahlia She got up and moved to the door In single file we
followed her on tiptoe to the nursery The baby was fast asleep
Thomas we all said in a whisper Thomas Thomas
There was no reply
Samuel
Dead silence
I think said Dahlia well call him Peter
IVHE IS CHRISTENED
On the morning of the christening as I was on my way to the bathroom I
met Simpson coming out of it There are people who have never seen
Simpson in his dressinggown people also who have never waited for the
sun to rise in glory above the snowcapped peaks of the Alps who have
never stood on Waterloo Bridge and watched St Pauls come through the
mist of an October morning Well well one cannot see everything
Hallo old chap he said I was just coming to talk to you I want
your advice
A glass of hot water the last thing at night I said no sugar or
milk a Turkish bath once a week and plenty of exercise Youll get it
down in no time
Dont be an ass I mean about the christening Ive been to a wedding
of course but that isnt quite the same thing
A moment while I turn on the tap I turned it on and came back to
him Now then Im at your service
Well whats theerusual costume for a christening
Leave that to the mother I said Shell see that the babys dressed
properly
I mean for a godfather
Dahlia has conveniently placed a sofa outside the bathroom door I
dropped into it and surveyed the dressinggown thoughtfully
Go like that I said at last
What I want to know is whether its a tophat affair or not
Have you brought a tophat
Of course
Then you must certainly I say Come out of it Myra
I jumped up from the sofa but it was too late She had stolen my bath
Well of all the cheek
The door opened and Myras head appeared round the corner
Hush youll wake the baby she said Oh Samuel what a dream Why
havent I seen it before
You have Myra Ive often dressed up in it
Then I suppose it looks different with a sponge Because
Really I said as I took hold of Simpson and led him firmly away if
the baby knew that you carried on like this of a morning hed be
shocked
Thomas is always late for breakfast Simpson on this occasion was
delayed by his elaborate toilet They came in last together by opposite
doors and stood staring at each other Simpson wore a frockcoat
dashing doublebreasted waistcoat perfectly creased trousers and a
magnificent cravat Thomas had on flannels and an old blazer
By Jove said Archie seeing Simpson first you are a and then
he caught sight of Thomas Hullo His eyes went from one to the
other and at last settled on the toast He went on with his breakfast
The two noble godfathers he murmured
Meanwhile the two godfathers continued to gaze at each other as if
fascinated At last Simpson spoke
We cant both be right he said slowly to himself
Thomas woke up
Is it the christening today I quite forgot
It is Thomas The boatrace is tomorrow
Well I can change afterwards You dont expect me to wear anything
like that he said pointing to Simpson
Dont change said Archie Both go as you are Mick and Mack the
Comedy Duo Simpson does the talking while Thomas falls over the pews
Simpson collected his breakfast and sat down next to Myra
Am I all right he asked her doubtfully
Your ties up at the back of your neck I said
Because if Dahlia would prefer it he went on ignoring me I could
easily wear a plain dark tweed
Youre beautiful Samuel said Myra I hope youll look as nice at my
wedding
You dont think I shall be mistaken for the father he asked
anxiously
By Peter Well that is just possible Perhaps if
I think youre right said Simpson and after breakfast he changed
into the plain dark tweed
As the hour approached we began to collect in the hall Simpson reading
the service to himself for the twentieth time
Do we have to say anything asked Thomas as he lit his third pipe
Simpson looked at him in horror
Say anything Of course we do Havent you studied it Here youll
just have time to read it through
Too late now Better leave it to the inspiration of the moment I
suggested Does anybody know if theres a collection because if so I
shall have to go and get some money
There will be a collection for the baby afterwards said Archie I
hope youve all been saving up
Here he comes said Simpson and Peter Blair Mannering came down the
stairs with Dahlia and Myra
Good morning everybody said Dahlia
Good morning Say Good morning baby
Hes rather nervous said Myra He says hes never been christened
before and whats it like
I expect hell be all right with two such handsome godfathers said
Dahlia
Isnt Mr Simpson looking well said Myra in a society voice And
do you know dear thats the third suit Ive seen him in today
Well are we all ready
Youre quite sure about his name said Archie to his wife This is
your last chance you know Say the word to Thomas before its too
late
I think Peter is rather silly I said
Why Blair said Myra I ask you
Dahlia smiled sweetly at us and led the way with P B Mannering to the
car We followed  and Simpson on the seat next the driver read the
service to himself for the last time
I feel very proud said Archie as we came out of the church Im not
only a father but my son has a name And now I neednt call him er
any more
He was a good boy wasnt he said Myra
Thomas say at once that your godson was a good boy
But Thomas was quiet He looked years older
Ive never read the service before he said I didnt quite know what
