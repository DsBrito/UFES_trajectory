INTRODUCTION
Four things are never far from you in old Hindoo literature underfoot
all round you or away on the horizon there they always are the
Forest the Desert the River and the Hills
It is never very easy to understand the Past that really is a past and
the age of Forests like that of chivalry is gone But in the case of
ancient India the chief obstacle to understanding arises from our bad
habit of always looking at the map with the North side up Why this
inveterate apotheosis of the North Would you understand the old
Hindoos you must turn the map of India very nearly upside down so as
to get Peshawar at the bottom and the Andaman Islands exactly at the
top And then history lies all before you right side up and you get
your intellectual bearings and take in the early situation at a
glance Entering like those old nomads through the Khaibar you find
yourself suddenly in the Land of Streams and as you drift along you
go simply because you must straight on down the River ganging on
Ganga towards the rising sun ahead which is the Sanskrit term
for East all under the colossal wall of Hills the home of Snow where
the gods live on your left uttara the North the heights while on
the South the right hand dakshina the Deccan you are debarred
not by Highlands but by two not less peremptory rebutters first by
the Desert Marusthali the home of death and then again a little
farther on by the Forest of the South the vast mysterious
impenetrable Wood of which the Ramayana preserves for us the pioneering
record and original idea with its spell of the Unknown and the
Adventure like the Westward Ho of a later age with its Ogres and its
Sprites its sandal trees and lonely lotustarns its armies of ugly
little apelike men and its legendary Lanka Ceylon lost in a kind of
halo of shellborn pearls and gems and their Tenheaded Devil King
Rawana away away at the very end of all so distant as to be little
more than mythical little better than a dream No Those who wish to
see things with the eyes of old Hindoos must not begin as we did and
do still with Ceylon and the adjacent coasts of Coromandel and
Malabar That is the wrong the other end it is like starting
English history from the peak in Darien
But our particular concern in these pages is with the Desert The
conventional notion of a desert as a colourless and empty flat of sand
is curiously unlike the thing itself which is a constantly changing
kaleidoscopic sea of colour made up of rainbow stripes black golden
red dazzling white and blue with every kind of lights and shadows
strange hazes transparencies and gleams True the ground you actually
tread upon is bare but it is clothed with raiment woven by that magic
artist Distance out of cloud and heat and air and sky And so when
these old Hindoo people came to make a closer acquaintance with the
Desert so dangerous to enter so difficult as Mahmood subsequently
found to cross they discovered that over and above the plain prosaic
danger this Waste of Sand laid like a very demon goblin snares for
the unwary travellers destruction in the form of its Mirage Ignorant
of optical phenomena they gazed at this strange illusion these
phantom trees and water these mocking semblances of cities that
vanished as you reached them with astonishment and even awe It struck
their imagination and they gave to it a name scarcely less poetical
than the thing calling it deerwater or the thirst of the
antelope1 Nor was this all For the apparition was a kind of
symbol made as it were expressly for their own phenomenology it
contained a moral meaning that harmonised precisely with all their
philosophical ideas What could be a better illustration of that MAYA
that metaphysical Delusion in which all souls are wrapped which leads
them to impute Reality to the Phantasms the unsubstantial objects of
the senses and lures them on to moral ruin as they wander in the waste
And accordingly we find the poets constantly recurring to this thirst
of the gazelle as an emblem of the treacherous and bewildering
fascination of the fleeting shadows of this lower life ihaloka the
beauty that is hollow the Bubble of the World And thus Disappointment
is of the essence of Existence disappointment which can only come
about when hopes and expectations have been founded on a want of
understanding awiweka a blindness born of Desire that sets and
keeps its unhappy victims hunting in vain for what is not to be found
Footnote 1 I am told by a pundit in these matters that the term is
found at least as early as Patanjali the Mahabhashya that is
probably the latter half of the second century BC and hence it must
have originated long before
Especially essentially in love love which has its origin in Dream
its acme in Ecstasy and its catastrophe in Disillusion love which is
lifes core and kernel and epitome the focus and quintessence of
existence A life that is without it has somehow missed its mark it is
meaningless and plotless a string of casual episodes like a bad
tragedy For what after all is Love Who has given an account of it
Platos fable which makes Love the child of Satiety and Want or
Poverty and Plenty is a pretty piece of fancy it is clever but like
mathematics an explanation of the brain rather than the heart
Something is missing For Plato almost always delicate and subtle is
never tender the reason is that he was atrophied on the feminine side
he does not consequently understand sex being himself only half a man
that is only man and nothing more But all the really great imaginative
men are bisexual they have a large ingredient of woman in their
composition which gives to their divination an extra touch of something
that others cannot reach And so with equal poetry yet with a pathos
infinitely deeper our Milton makes Love the child of Loneliness2 a
parentage evinced by the terrible melancholy of Love when he cannot find
his proper object and the blank desolation and despair of the frightful
void and blackness left behind when he has lost it But now it is
just this intolerable loneliness which makes him idealise the
commonplace and see all things in the light of his own yearning
creating for himself visions of unimaginable happiness which presently
vanish to resolve his Eden into nothing and leave him with no
companion but the horror of his own intensified isolation in the sand
A situation which hardly any lover that really is a lover can endure
without going mad They are very shallow theologians who by way of
pandering to sentimental prejudices make the essence of the Deity to
consist in Love Poor Deity his life would be a Hell past all human
imagination an everlasting Loneliness with no prospect of release For
it is precisely to escape from this hell that so many forlorn lovers
take refuge in the tomb a resource not available to those who cannot
die Death is not always terrible sometimes he is kind
Footnote 2 In his Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce
Such then is the theme of Bubbles of the Foam a little lovestory
whose title like that of all her elder sisters has in the original a
double application by reason of the ambiguity of the last word to
Love and to the Moon We might also render it A Heavenly Bubble or
Love is a Bubble or Nothing but a Bubble or A Bubble of the
World3 thinking either of Love or the Moon For the Moon like the
goddess of Love rose originally from the sea and they retain traces of
their origin both in their essence and their appearance For what is
more like a great FoamBubble than the Moon and what is more like the
delusion of love than a bubble of the foam so beautiful in its play of
colour while it endures so evanescent so hollow leaving behind it
when it bursts and disappears nothing but a memory and a bitter taste
of brine And as love is but a bubble so are all its victims merely
bubbles of a bubble for this also is mirage
Footnote 3 I was sorely tempted to give it the title of Mere Foam
which if the reader would kindly understand mere in its German its
Russian its Latin and its ordinary English sense would be an exact
translation But it has an unfortunate suggestion meerschaum which
made it impossible
Mirage mirage That is the keynote of the old melancholy Indian music
the bass whose undertone accompanies with a kind of monotonous
solemnity all the treble variations in the minor key The world is
unreal a delusion and a snare sense is deception happiness a dream
nothing has true being is absolute but virtue the sole reality that
which most emphatically IS4 attainable only through knowledge the
great illuminator the awakener to the perception of the truth We move
like marionettes pulled by the strings of our forgotten antenatal
deeds in a magic cage or Net of false and hypocritical momentary
seemings and bitter disappointment is the inevitable doom of every
soul that with passion for its guide in the gloom thinks to find in
the shadows that surround it any substance any solid satisfaction any
permanent in the mutable any rest in the ceaseless revolution any
peace which the world cannot give Who would have peace must turn his
back upon the world it lies the Other Way Three are the Ways the Way
of the World the Way of Woman the Way of Emancipation
Footnote 4 Sat The thesis of Socrates that virtue is knowledge
probably borrowed by steps that we cannot trace through Pythagoras or
Orpheus from the East
Does anyone in Europe care about this last this Way of Emancipation
No it is Liberty that preoccupies the European who about a century ago
seemed like the old Athenian suddenly to catch sight of Liberty in a
dream5 And yet who knows For Europe also is disappointed there
seems after all to be something lacking to this Liberty something
wrong With her Utopias ending in blind alleys or issues unforeseen
with her sages discovered to be less sages than they seemed with her
Science turning superstitious her Literature wallowing in the gutter
and her women descending from the pedestal of sex to play the virago in
the contamination of the crowd with so many other things not here to
be considered to raise a doubt whether this Liberty is taking her just
where she wished to go what wonder if even Europe should begin to
meditate on means of emancipation even if only from vulgarity and
steal a furtive glance or two towards the East to see whether by
diligently raking in the ashes of ancient oriental creeds she might not
discover here and there a spark at which to rekindle the expiring
candle of her own For there seems to be some curious indestructible
asbestos some element of perennial imperturbable tranquillity and
calm away in India which is conspicuous only by its absence in the
worry of the West Where does it come from What does it consist in Is
there a secret which India has discovered which Europe cannot guess Is
there anything in it after all but barbaric superstition destined to
fade away and disappear in the sunrise of omniscience
Footnote 5 Greek honar heleutherias horhontas Plutarch
I cannot tell but well I recollect a fugitive impression left on me by
an early morning in Benares now many years ago I threaded its
extraordinary streets narrower than the needles eye and crowded with
strange lithe nearly naked human beings with black straight long
wet hair and brown shining skins jostled at every step by holy bulls
or cows roaming at their own sweet will with large placid lustrous
eyes in an atmosphere heavy with the halfdelicious halfrepulsive
odour of innumerable flowers mostly yellow that lay about everywhere
in heaps fresh and rotten till I came out finally upon the river bank
A light steamy mist converted by the low suns horizontal rays into a
kind of reddishgolden veil hung in the quiet air lending an almost
magical effect to the long row of great temples whose steps run down
into the river along the northern bank half of them in ruins and
looking as if they must presently slide away into the water and
disappear And as I floated slowly down I watched with curiosity half
wondering if I was dreaming the throng of devotees sitting lying
gliding here and there like an antique procession on an old Greek
frieze or vase some muttering and praying others bathing others again
standing motionless as statues in the stream buried in a sort of
samadhi meditation every outline of every attitude in that clear
Indian air as sharp as if cut with scissors out of paper And lying
close beside cheek by jowl with the bodies still alive the ashes of
dead bodies just burned or still burning on the Ghat Life and Death
touching running into one another and nobody amazed all as it should
be and a matter of course
England and India bureaucracy democracy sedition education politics
and Durbarsthe world with all its tumult and its roaring passes clean
over their heads unheeded unobserved for them the noise and bustle do
not matter do not trouble they do not hear they do not listen they
do not even care It is curious this peace this indifference this
calm it does not seem reality it is like a thing looked at in a
picture like a dream And somehow as I gazed at it mechanically
there came into my mind as it were of its own accord a story I had
read in some old navigators yarn of the albatross sleeping on the
great South Sea in the fury of a storm with its head beneath its wing
CEYLON 1912

A SPOILED CHILD
I
A SPOILED CHILD
BENEDICTION
A bow to the mystical evening dance of the Rider on the Mouse6 who
whirling round his elephant trunk smeared with wet vermilion suddenly
shoots it straight up into the purple sky and stands for a single
instant still poised in the yellow twilight as if to make a coral
handle for the white umbrella of the laughing Moon
Footnote 6 Ganesha
I
There is in the western quarter a land of lonely desolation that
resembles a very sea but of sand instead of brine and rightly named
Marusthali being a very home of death sending back to the midday sun
rays hotter than his own and challenging the midnight sky with silent
ashy laughter as though to say What am I but the rival and reflection
of thyself with bones instead of stars and tracks of wasted skeletons
instead of a Milky Way And there upon a day it came about that
Maheshwara was roaming with Parwati in his arms And as they floated
swiftly on over the dusty waste they watched their own huge shadows
sweeping like the forms of clouds across the burning sand exactly
underneath for it was noon and the surface of the desert shook and
quivered in the stillness as if the wind asleep had like a tired
traveller sought refuge from the fury of the sun above their heads And
all at once the Daughter of the Snow exclaimed See there is the
mirage Let us descend and sit for a little while upon the sand for I
love to watch this wonder which resembles in its far faint blue the
colour of a dream And accordingly to do her pleasure Maheshwara sank
softly to the earth settling on it like a cloud gently resting on a
hill
So as they looked after a while that slender goddess said again
Surely it is a shame and well may the poor antelopes be mistaken and
deceived For who could believe yonder water to be only an illusion And
when the eyes of even gods are bewildered by the cheat how much more
the eyes of thirsty and unreflecting little deer
Then the Moonycrested deity said slowly O Daughter of the Snow thy
own reflection on this beautiful illusion is the truth And yet well
were it for the world were its illusion limited only to its eyes not
extending as it actually does to its understanding also For this
deceptive picture on the sand is far inferior in power and importance to
the bewildering delusion of this world below fluttering about whose
shifting dancing light like moths about a windblown torch men singe
their silly souls and burning off their wings drop helpless maimed
and mutilated into the black gulf of birth and death and lose
emancipation till after countless ages their wings begin to sprout
and grow again under the influence of works Yet they who after all
emerge and soar away unburdened even by an atom of the guilt that
weighs them down and brings them back into the vortex of rebirth are
very few And yonder bones now lying in the sand could they but rise
and speak would be a proof of what I say
And the goddess looked and saw close by a little heap of bones that
lay halfburied in the sand And she said with curiosity Whose are the
bones and how are they a proof of thy consideration
And Maheshwara replied These are bones not of a man but of a camel
that perished in the desert long ago For into this body of a camel
fell the soul of which I spoke in punishment of crimes committed in the
birth before in the body of a man who blinded by passion slew three
of his fellow mortals as if thou wilt I will tell thee while we sit
watching the illusion of the senses that so closely represents the
illusion of the souls of the lovers in the tale
II
Know then that once upon a time long ago all the gods had assembled
in the hall of Indras palace to listen to a singing competition that
took place among the Gandharwas And all sat listening attentively till
at length all at once came a pause in the performance And in the
silence while all the heavenly singers rested it so fell out by the
decree of destiny that the floweryarrowed god7 striving to
recollect a cadence that had pleased him hummed it as well as he
could over again aloud and like the unskilful imitator that he was
played havoc with his model stumbling at the quarter tones and singing
fiat And out of delicacy and politeness the gods all turned away their
faces hiding their smiles except Brahma8 whose face never moved
But Kamadewa looking up suddenly caught the vestige of a smile
hovering just before it disappeared on the corner of the lips of
Saraswati as if it were unwilling to leave a restingplace so
unutterably sweet as that lovely ladys mouth And instantly he turned
red and pale alternately with rage that followed shame so little does
he who delights in making others blush like doing it himself And
suddenly taking fire he cried aloud Ha dost thou turn me into
ridicule O thou malapert bluestocking9 Then will I curse thee for
thy pains Fall instantly into a lower birth and suffer anguish in the
form of a mortal woman for thy presumption and illmannered mirth
Footnote 7 ie the god of love Kamadewa
Footnote 8 It would have been useless for Brahma to turn away his
face since he has four one on every side
Footnote 9 Kupandita the exact equivalent of our word Saraswati is
the Hindoo Pallas Athene with this distinction in her favour that she
is as gentle as the Greek lady is the reverse The flava virago of
Ovid becomes in India a lotus white and pure as her own celestial
smile
And instantly all the other gods hearing him broke out into a very
storm of indignation And buzzing like infuriated bees around one who
seeks to rob them of their honey they swarmed about that god of love
exclaiming all together What shall Heaven be bereft even for a very
little while of the very crestjewel of its brow because of thy loss
of selfcontrol and a fault on her part which was not a fault at all
but only the appropriate reproof of thy illadvised endeavour to play
the musician without possessing the necessary skill And there arose a
tumult in the hall and finally they made me arbitrator to settle the
dispute knowing that Ananga was afraid of me as well might he be10
And so after all were silent I spoke And I said very slowly O
bender of that bow whose string is a row of bees thou art surely
altogether inexcusable first for thy singing and secondly for thy loss
of temper and finally for thy curse For who could be so harsh as to
strike Saraswati even with a shirisha petal But now the mischief is
utterly beyond repair and once spoken the curse cannot be
recalled11 And whether she will or no she must now go to earth and
leave us for a time till thy curse has spent its force And yet for
all that it is not right that the doer of injustice such as thine
should escape scotfree Therefore now I will give thee curse for
curse and thou shalt eat the fruit of thy own tree Fall then
immediately into the body of a man and suffer that mortality which thou
hast laid upon Saraswati And thy fortune shall be interwoven with her
own so that thy curse shall be determined by the quality and period of
hers
Footnote 10 Because Maheshwara had burned him on a previous occasion
with fire from his eye
Footnote 11 In these and similar ideas the Hindoos resembled the
ancient Romans the letter was decisive and irremediable uti lingua
nuncupassit ita jus esto
And then as he listened to my doom Kamadewa turned paler than the
ashes to which I had reduced him long ago finding himself punished for
his insolence by me for the second time But the gods all exclaimed
with approbation and delight Victory to Maheshwara who has once more
bitten the biter and condemned him by a sentence even more merciful
than he deserved For what could be more intolerable than even Heaven
without Saraswati unless it be the curse that is about to produce such
a melancholy condition of affairs
And then those two deities disappeared suddenly from Heaven and
descended to be born as man and woman on the earth12
Footnote 12 This exordium which has points of resemblance with that
of the insufferable Banas Harshacharita is only the Hindoo method
of declaring that the two characters presently to be brought upon the
scene are mortal incarnations of love and charm as we call a man an
Adonis or a woman a Venus
III
Now just at that very moment it happened that there were living in the
desert two Rajpoots of the race of the Moon and the name of the one was
Bimba and that of the other Jaya13 And Saraswati was born as the
daughter of the wife of Bimba while Kamadewa was born as the son of the
wife of Jaya Now Bimba was a king and Jaya was his cousin on the
mothers side And very soon afterwards Jaya set upon his cousin
laying claim to the throne and driving him away took his kingdom and
kept it for himself And he caught the wife of Bimba and put her to
death as he would have done also with her daughter and her husband But
Bimba succeeded in escaping with his daughter and ran away and hid
himself So Jaya remained in triumph reigning over the kingdom whose
capital stood on the very spot on which we are sitting now For the
kingdoms of the earth come and go upon it like the shadows of the
clouds and they grow up suddenly like grass and perish a little later
and vanish clean away leaving behind them absolutely nothing but
mounds such as those now lying all about thee and fragments of
recollections and halfforgotten names like the dreams of the night
which morning obliterates and drives away vaguely hanging in its memory
like wreaths of mist curling and twisting on the black still surface of
a pool in some dark valley screened from the early sun by one of thy
fathers14 peaks
Footnote 13 ie the disc of the moon and victory Pronounce Jaya
to rhyme with eye
Footnote 14 ie the Himalaya
And of all the elements that made up Javas good fortune there was not
one which filled him with such pride and exultation as his son And he
looked upon him as the very fruit of his birth in visible form little
dreaming that could he but have looked into the future and seen what
was coming he would rather have deemed himself more fortunate to live
and die without any son at all than to have begotten such a son as he
actually had For sons resemble winds which sometimes lift their
families like clouds to heaven and sometimes dash them to the earth
like hail
For having waited so long to get a son at all till hope was all but
gone the joy of both his parents when he actually arrived was so
extravagantly great that they could not make too much of him And as he
grew up they spoiled him so completely by the want of all discretion
in their admiration and the flattery of their affectionate caresses
that after a while he became utterly intolerable even to themselves
And this came about not only by reason of their own foolishness but
also by the very disposition and qualities of that son himself For he
was so marvellously beautiful that every time they saw him they could
hardly believe their own eyes and were ready to abandon the body out of
joy And in the intoxication of delight they gave him the name of
Atirupa15 which was no more than he deserved And he became a byword
and a wonder in the world till the heart of his mother almost broke
with the swelling of its own pride For nothing like him had ever been
seen by anybody even in a dream since his beauty did not in the least
resemble that of other men but hovered as it were halfway between one
sex and the other as if the Creator when he made him unable to decide
whether to make of him a man or a woman had combined by some miracle
of omnipotence and skill the fascinations of the two For though he was
tall and strong yet strange his body and his limbs were rounded and
delicately shaped and slender with soft and tender hands and feet that
were almost too small even for a girl and as he moved he fell as if
by accident into attitudes that as it were imitated unconsciously the
careless grace of Shri16 caught unaware when she thinks that there is
nobody to look at her and carved by a cunning sculptor in stone upon a
temple wall so that the eyes of all followed him as if against their
will drawn to him by an involuntary admiration that they could not
understand not realising that in his case only the beauty of their own
sex was reinforced and as it were reduplicated with the magic of a
spell by the mysterious and additional fascination of the other And
his face was so strange that whoever saw it started and fell after a
little while into a kind of dream And yet this was not merely by
reason of its beauty though that beauty was excessive resembling a
vision seen suddenly in the water by a Dryad musing at midnight by a
moonlit pool with eyes that resembled the reflections of the shadows of
the lotuses and eyebrows that met together in the middle of his brow
each drawn exactly in imitation of the other like a lotusfibre half in
and half out of water and lips that were almost too red resembling
that lovesick nymphs own pair of bimba lips mirrored17 in the
clear black water and dying to be kissed by others like themselves
But wonderful the Creator had put into his face some ingredient of
recollection so that without knowing why every beholder found himself
plunged as it were into the agitation of dreamy reminiscence and said
within himself Ha now somewhere or other in this birth or another I
have seen that miracle of a face before And each went away with a heart
that was unwilling to depart haunted as it were by dim desire for
something he knew not what stirring in the depths of his memory that he
could not remember and yet had not forgotten like the thirst for the
repetition of the sweetness of a bygone dream18 And all the more
because his voice resembled a music that was playing a melody suggested
by the theme of his face For it was low and soft like that of a woman
and yet deep like that of a man and it seemed to be made of sound
stolen from the pipe of Krishna in order to enable it itself to steal
away the senses of the world so that as he spoke the listener
gradually grew bewildered by its tone resembling a tired traveller
falling little by little unconsciously to sleep as he sits in the murmur
of a mountain stream And whenever he chose he could cajole his
hearer and make him do almost anything whatever so hard was it to
resist the irresistible persuasion that lurked like the caressing touch
of a gentle womans hand in the tone of that quiet and insinuating
voice
Footnote 15 ie of extraordinary and surpassing beauty Pronounce
Uttirupa
Footnote 16 The Hindoo Aphrodite
Footnote 17 There is here an untranslateable play on bimba the
fruit as we say cherry lip and pratibimba a reflection in the
water
Footnote 18 All this depends on an elaborate play on the double
meaning of Smara a name for the God of Love which means memory as
well as love
And yet all this beauty was nothing but a mask and a lie and so far
from expressing the nature of that soul which it covered and disguised
it actually added evil to its original defect and he resembled a
bamboo looking like a very incarnation of loveliness and symmetry
outside and singing in the wind and yet absolutely hollow and without
a heart within For from the very moment he was born he did exactly as
he pleased and nothing else being as capricious as the breeze that
blows only as it chooses For beginning with his parents nobody ever
crossed him or placed any obstacle whatever in the path of his desires
which grew up accordingly like a very rank jungle impervious to the
light in which his will wandered like a wild young tigercub wayward
and passionate and absolutely uncontrolled And he gave in to others
and was guided by them in one point only and that was in their
extravagant admiration of himself For finding others worship him he
fell in with their opinion and followed their example and became as it
were the devotee at the shrine of his own beauty making it a deity to
which every other thing or body was only fitted to be sacrificed And he
filled his rooms with mirrors of many colours made of crystal and
lapizlazuli and polished gold and silver and the water of tanks whose
slabs were of marble of every variety of hue and he used to sit alone
when he had nothing else to do for hours watching his own image that
seemed to offer him reciprocally worship as he watched it as if it were
doubtful which of the two the reality or its reflection was the deity
and which the devotee
And gradually the world with all its objects came to appear in his eyes
as nothing but a playground and all its men and women merely his own
animated toys And from being utterly indifferent to everything but his
own momentary pleasure and caprice he became little by little first
callous to the sufferings of others and finally positively cruel
finding his amusement in making others victims to his own peremptory
desires And his appetite like a fire grew with the fuel that it fed
upon till it resembled voracity and an intolerable thirst for more
But as long as he remained still a child the fire remaining as it were
without its proper aliment lay hidden till he grew into a man And
then all at once it blazed out furiously like a very conflagration
striking terror into all the subjects of the kingdom and threatening to
consume them all like forest trees and grass
For whereas till then the fury of his selfwill had been scattered
for want of concentration19 on one object only manhood like a flash
of lightning suddenly revealed to him that very object in the form of
woman and he discovered in the storm of his delight that women were
the very victims for whom he had been blindly groping in the darkness
all his life And he threw himself upon them like a prey finding with
intoxication that the Creator had framed him as a weapon constructed
wholly for their destruction And he said to himself in triumph I am
as it seems a magnetic gem omnipotent and irresistible to whose
attraction the entire sex succumbs inevitably like grass And this
opinion was justified by the conduct of the women themselves For every
woman that set eyes on him no matter who she was fell instantly like
a stone dropped into a well without a bottom into the abyss of
