THE FALKE TYPE TORPEDO BOAT
Among the different classes of vessels designed for special services
constructed by Messrs Yarrow  Co at Poplar for the British
government is one which is stated to be the fastest torpedo boat in her
majestys navy This boat has been put through its official trials with
a load of 15 tons running continuously for two hours without stopping
a speed of 23 knots which is equal to 2612 statute miles an hour was
obtained The boat is 135 ft long by 14 ft beam Its design is known
as the Falke type being in many respects similar but very superior to
a torpedo boat of that name which was built two years ago by the same
firm for the Austrian government The form of the hull is of such a
character as to give exceptional steering capabilities at the time of
trial it was found to be able to steer round in a circle of a diameter
of 100 yards averaging 62 seconds The forward part of the boat is
completely covered over by a large turtle back which is the customary
form of the boats built by Messrs Yarrow  Co It was first introduced
in the Batoum which they constructed eight years ago for the Russian
government This turtle back increases the seaworthiness of the craft by
throwing the water that comes upon it freely away It forms also good
and roomy accommodation for the crew and incloses a large portion of
the torpedo apparatus The forward torpedo gear consists of one torpedo
gun adapted for ejecting the Whitehead torpedo by means of gunpowder
now preferred on account of its simplicity The boiler one of Messrs
Yarrow  Cos special construction of a type which has undergone many
years of constant trial is capable of developing 1660 horse power In
the engine room there are six enginesone for driving the boat two for
compressing the air for the torpedoes an engine for working the dynamo
for producing the electric light an engine for forcing air into the
stokehole and an engine working in conjunction with the distilling
apparatus for supplying drinking water for the crew and the waste
incidental to the boiler Aft of the engine room come the officers
quarters The stern of the boat is fitted up as a pantry and for the
stowage of ammunition and stores On the deck are mounted three machine
guns and near the stern an additional conning tower for use in case of
need around which revolve two torpedo guns for firing the torpedoes off
either side These torpedo guns can be trained to any angle it may be
desired to fire them at On both conning towers are machine
gunsIllustrated London News

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT
THE GERMAN NAVYTHE NEW GUNBOAT EBER
The gunboat Eber is an improved vessel of the Wolf type but differs
from other vessels of its class in that it has not a complete iron hull
only the frame and deck beams being of iron while the planking is of
wood and yellow metal No copper is used on the bottom The composite
system of building is looked upon with favor for ships of this kind
because iron vessels which are kept permanently at stations in the
tropics soon become overgrown in spite of good care and thus suffer a
great loss of speed In a wooden vessel the crews quarters are better
and more healthful than in iron vessels for they are not as much
affected by the temperature outside of the ship
The greatest length of the Eber is about 245 ft its breadth 26 ft
its depth 14 ft and it has a displacement of about 500 tons The
armament will consist of three long 5 in guns in center pivot
carriages and a small number of revolvers One of the former will be
placed at the stern on the quarter deck and the two others on the
forecastle Some of the revolvers will be on the quarter deck and some
on the forecastle care being taken to arrange the guns so as to obtain
the widest possible range thus enabling the ship to protect itself
perfectly
Illustration THE NEW GERMAN GUNBOAT EBER
The Eber is provided with a twocylinder compound engine which can
generate 650 horse power giving the vessel a speed of 1112 knots The
coal bunkers are so large that the ship can travel 3000 miles at a
speed slightly less than that just mentioned without requiring a fresh
supply of coal The rigging is the same as in iron vessels of the Wolf
class and the sails are sufficiently large to allow the vessel to
proceed without steam The ship will carry about 90 men including
officers crew engineers and firemen
A sum of 145000 was appropriated for the construction and equipment of
the Eber which was begun at Kiel in the latter part of 1885 and was
launched February 15 1887Illustrirte Zeitung
NEW BRITISH TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS
The torpedo experiments against the Resistance which have been
suspended since November last were resumed on June 9 at Portsmouth by
the officers of the Vernon The injuries received by the ironclad in the
previous experiments having been repaired so as to make the vessel
watertight the old ship was towed up the harbor and moored in Fareham
Creek Our readers are aware that the Resistance is an obsolete ironclad
which has finished her career as a battle ship and that nothing could
have converted her into a modern armorclad
Although it was intended to render the experiments final and conclusive
as a practical demonstration under service conditions of the destructive
effects of the Whitehead torpedo when directed against a modern vessel
of war the results still leave behind them much uncertainty The
Resistance was built of iron whereas battle ships are now exclusively
constructed of steel and it would be perhaps hazardous to state that
the behavior of the two metals under a sudden and violent shock would be
exactly the same The construction of the double bottom of the old ship
is also different Since the last experiments were carried out against
her however measures have been taken to make her as far as possible
the counterpart so far as under water arrangements and coal protection
are concerned of a modern ship of war
At the last attack the Whitehead was directed against the after part of
the hull on the port side in wake of the boilers During the present
series of experiments the old ship was assailed on the same side but
directly amidships in the neighborhood of the engine room As no steam
was got up in the boilers the effect of the jar upon the steam pipes
glands and feed connections remains a matter of speculation So far as
the consequences of the burst upon the structure of the hull itself is
concerned every care was taken to make the ordeal as complete and
instructive as possible The wing passage which has a maximum diameter
of 3 ft diminishing to a point was left empty although at the former
experiments the lower portions were filled with coal But behind this
and at a distance of 8 ft from the bulkhead a longitudinal or fore and
aft steel bulkhead 38 in thick had been worked to a length of 61 ft
and with the coal with which the intervening compartment was packed
formed as in recent armorclads a solid rampart 20 ft high for the
defense of the engine room
The height of the double bottom between the outer and inner skin plating
is 212 ft The watertight compartments were divided into stations by
means of vertical lightening plates pierced by three holes and in order
to make them as far as was practicable resemble the bracket frames of
a modern armorclad the center of the plates was cut away so as to leave
a single oval hole instead of the three circular holes In view of the
differences of opinion which exist on the part of experts on the subject
of under water protection the officers of the Vernon had determined to
submit the problem to the test of experiment For this purpose steel
armor 112 in thick had been worked along the outside of the upper skin
of the double bottom throughout one of the compartments in addition to
the other protection mentioned The Resistance had been brought down by
iron ballast to a trim of 25 feet 9 in aft and 19 ft 7 in forward
giving a mean draught of 22 feet 8 inches She was consequently rather
further down by the stern than before but was in other respects the
same
When in commission the Resistance had a mean draught of 26 feet 10
inches The present series of experiments was of even greater importance
than the first series The attack was gradually developed by means of
fixed and outrigger charges of increasing power and the coup de grace
was not given by means of a service Whitehead in actual contact until
various lessons had been derived
The opening experiment on June 9 consisted of an attack directed against
a new system of torpedo defenses which are to be carried by ships in
action or when in expectation of an attack rather than an assault upon
the ship herself The previous experiments had clearly demonstrated that
a Whitehead when projected against a vessel at close range and
consequently with a maximum of motive force could not get through the
ordinary wire netting before expending its explosive energy in the air
and that the spars by which the nets are boomed out from the ships side
could be reduced to 25 ft in length without danger to the hull The
ordinary wooden booms employed on board ship however are heavy and
unwieldy weighing as they do more than half a ton each In ordinary
circumstances the spars cannot be lowered into place and the nets made
taut in less than a couple of hours and the work of stowing them is
equally slow and laborious
Mr Bullivant who manufactures the torpedo netting and hawsers for the
navy has devised a method of getting rid of the difficulties complained
of by substituting steel booms for the wooden booms and an arrangement
of pulleys and runners whereby the protection can be run out and in
topped and brailed up out of the way with great facility The system
was tried at Portsmouth last year with considerable success upon the
Dido but as it was thought that some of the fittings were somewhat
frail and might collapse beneath the shock of a live torpedo it was
resolved to submit them to a practical test under service conditions
upon the Resistance The ship was consequently fitted with three of the
steel booms on the port side They were 32 ft long and spaced 45 ft
apart and connected by a jackstay to which the nets were attached Each
steel boom weighed 5 cwt or less than half the weight of the ordinary
boom and whereas the latter is fixed to the ships side by a hook which
is liable to be disconnected or broken by the jerk of an exploding
torpedo Mr Bullivants boom works in a universal or socket joint
which cannot get out of gear except by fracture and which permits the
boom to be moved in any direction whether vertically or fore and aft
close in against the sides Below each boom is a flange which serves as
a line along which a traveler moves the latter being actuated by means
of a topping line running over a pulley at the head and another near the
heel
Upon the booms being topped to a perpendicular position the nets are
attached to the runners at the bottom of the booms close inboard
instead of under the existing system to the tops of the booms from
boats alongside or otherwise and when this is done the mere
depression of the booms into position will cause the nets to run out of
their own accord In like manner when the occasion for their use has
passed the raising of the boom will cause the nets to come alongside
when they can either be brailed up through the grummets or disconnected
for future use
The action of the gear is so simple and rapid that the torpedo
protection can be always ready without arresting the way of the ship As
a length of net 30 ft by 20 ft deep weighs about 3 cwt it will also
be seen that the reduction of strains by working the crinolines from the
heel instead of the head of the booms is considerable The attack by the
Whitehead upon the booms and nettings was made shortly before 2 pm at
the time of high tide
The whole affair occupied a very few minutes As soon as the red pennant
was struck on board to show that Mr Bullivant was satisfied with the
arrangements and that the target was ready the torpedo vessel Vesuvius
got under way and after circling round the doomed hulk discharged a
Whitehead against the netting from her underwater bow torpedo tube at
an approximate range of 50 yards As on former occasions the missile
was one of the old 16 inch pattern but it was understood that the
charge of gun cotton had been reduced to 87 lb so that the net
protection should not bear a greater strain than would be the case in
actual hostilities The torpedo which was set to a depth of about 10
feet struck the net in the middle and threw up an immense spout of
water but without getting to the ship which was apparently uninjured
Although it hit the net immediately below the center boom no fracture
occurred and the points remained intact Although at the short range
the torpedo would spin through the water at from 30 to 40 horse power
and would deliver a formidable blow upon the net the thrust was
effectually resisted though as a matter of course the net was much torn
by the explosion of the baffled projectile
Although at the second torpedo attack made on the Resistance the
following day the offensive power that was brought to bear was quite
exceptional the victory remained with the ship The charge exploded was
an exceptionally heavy one It consisted of 220 lb of gun cotton It
was consequently more destructive than any which is ever likely to be
launched against an armorclad much better prepared to resist it than the
obsolete and timeworn Resistance An idea however had got abroad that
the Russians either have or intend to have a locomotive torpedo capable
of carrying the same weight of explosive in its head and the object of
the experiment was to ascertain what would be the effect of the
detonation of such an enormous charge upon the submerged portions of a
ship of war
But while this was no doubt the primary purpose in view the experiment
also served the secondary purpose of determining the result of the
explosion upon the net defenses of a ship Mr Bullivants booms and
runners which were found to be scarcely anything the worse from the
ordeal of the previous day were again used The damaged net was taken
away and one of the old service grummet nets slung in its place the
cylinders containing the gun cotton being attached to the jackstay
immediately in front of the battered sides and 30 feet from the hulk
and sunk to a distance of 20 feet below the water line which would
bring it about opposite the bend of the bilge By 3 pm everything was
ready for the explosion of the chargeeverybody had cleared out of the
ship while the surrounding small craft drew off to a distance of 300
feet The charge was electrically fired from a pinnace The burst was
terrific and the reverberation was heard and the shock distinctly felt
in the dockyard But the remarkable thing was that the hulk did not
appear to jump in the least though there was not more than six feet of
water under her keel That she would not be seriously crippled by the
discharge seems to have been accepted as a foregone conclusion by
Captain Long and the other torpedoists as the day for the third
experiment had been fixed in advance but that the steel booms with
their double flange running ways stays travelers and hinges should
have resisted the tremendous jar and upheaval was a genuine surprise for
all concerned and goes far to prove that except a vessel be taken
unawares it will be impossible for a torpedo to come into actual
contact with it At the experiments last year the wooden booms were
unhinged and splintered under a much less violent shock But the steel
booms employed though somewhat bent remained unbroken and in position
and the joints were quite uninjured All that is necessary for perfect
defense is that the booms should be made a little heavier
The torpedo experiments against the Resistance were resumed on June 13
when the old ironclad suffered some rough treatment As the experiment
was understood to be the last of the second series and was fully
expected to have a sensational termination a considerable number of
interested spectators were attracted to the scene in Fareham Creek The
torpedoists resorted to severe measures but with a distinctly useful
purpose in view having bound the ship hand and foot so to speak in
such a way that her name became a solecism They exploded 95 lb of gun
cotton 20 ft below the water and in contact with her double bottom
This amount of explosive represents the full charge of the old pattern
16 in Whiteheads but as the hulk was for prudential reasons moored
close to a mud bank and as the water was consequently much too shallow
to allow of a locomotive torpedo being set to run at the required depth
a fixed charge was lashed fore and aft against the bottom plating of the
ship and electrically exploded from No 95 torpedo boat
In previous experiments this year the ironclad was attacked on the port
side which had been specially strengthened for the occasion and the
result was a victory for the defense On June 13 the starboard side was
selected for attack in order that a comparison might be instituted with
the effects produced under different conditions by a similar experiment
Last year in the latter case the double bottom was filled with coal and
after the charge which was lashed against the ship in the same way had
been exploded it was found that the bilge keel had been shivered for a
length of 20 ft while the lower plating had been much bulged above the
bilge keel Four strakes of the skin plating extending up to the armor
shelf had also been forced inward and fractured where they crossed the
longitudinal frames They had parted in the middle for a distance of 8
ft while some of the butts had been opened so that gashes 2 in or 3
in wide appeared between them The coal had been pulverized and
scattered in all directions and other internal damage inflicted
Nevertheless the watertight bulkheads remained intact and by confining
the influx of water to a single compartment so much buoyancy was
preserved that though the ship heeled over to starboard and was maimed
she remained afloat and might have continued to fight her guns
provided always that no injury had been sustained by her machinery a
point which these experiments do not touch Crippled however as she
was it was thought at the time and the probability was strengthened by
subsequent examination of the ship in dock that the coal instead of
being a protection to the double bottom had in reality proved a source
of weakness by receiving the energy of the explosion from the outer
plating and communicating it to the inner plating and so distributing
it throughout the submerged portions of the hulk
The question was sufficiently important to demand an experimental
solution hence the raison detre of the present demonstration The
double bottom which is about 212 ft deep was consequently kept empty
and the torpedo placed in immediate contact with it in such a manner
that being overhung by the contour of the hull the ship would feel the
full force of the upward as well as the lateral energy of the charge On
other accounts the importance of the experiment was obvious for
although it had been ascertained that torpedo nets were capable of
protecting a battle ship from the bursts of the heaviest locomotive and
outrigger charges it might happen of course that the nets would be
rent or displaced by shell fire or swept away by a grazing ram or even
attacked by a double torpedo the second passing through the gashes made
by the explosion of the first in any case It was therefore of urgent
necessity that the effect of a torpedo bursting in immediate contact
with a ships bottom should be practically and clearly determined The
charge on June 13 was fired just before 5 pm in the wake of the
boilers and it was soon perceived that something of a fatal character
had taken place from the appearance of coal dust sweeping up through the
hold The report had not the dull boom to which the spectators had
become accustomed Instead of this the gun cotton exploded with a
sharp angry whistling noise while the manner in which the mud was
churned up showed that the force of the rebound was terrific The ship
lifted bodily near the stern after which it was seen to leisurely heel
over to starboard some eight or ten degrees and finally repose though
not until the tide fell upon the mud The old hulk had been mortally
wounded at last
A complete knowledge of the disaster which has overtaken her says the
correspondent of the London Times to which we are indebted for the
above particulars will not be obtained until a careful investigation
has been made of the hull in dock But from a hasty exploration which
was conducted on board it was evident that the shot had not only
dislocated the inner plating of the double bottom but had penetrated
the bunker compartment stored as it was with coal that the watertight
doors and compartments had ceased to operate and that water was flowing
into the hull through a hundred crevices To such an extent was this the
case that though a strong working party was at hand ready for any
emergency it was deemed useless to attempt to free the ship of water
until her gashes had been temporarily closed from outside When this has
been done she will be pumped out and brought into dock for careful
examination From what has been said it will be seen that while the
explosion of 95 lb of gun cotton in actual contact last November simply
crippled the Resistance the explosion of a like charge at the same
spot and under approximately the same conditions has in this instance
not simply disabled but really sunk the ship
AN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING
The new automatic railway coupling illustrated below is the invention of
Mr Richard Hill and has been practically developed by Mr BH
Thwaite of Liverpool It will be seen that the system is somewhat
similar to the parallel motion when in action
The catch and peculiarly shaped hooks slide over the cross and catch
bars These latter turn horizontally on a central pivot attached to the
jaw end of the drawbar The cross catch bars adjust themselves to the
direction of the line of pull in the drawbar The cranking of the
drawbar allows for the deflection of the buffer springs
The arrangement of uncoupling or throwing hooks out of gear is
extremely simple and effective The cranked part of the rod passing
across the end of the wagon and with handles at each end workable from
the 6 ft way is attached to the catch hooks by means of a light chain
On throwing the handle over and against the end of the wagon the crank
moves over and below the center lifting up the catch into a position
out of range of action and from this position it cannot fall except it
is released by the shunter A shackle and links hang from the end of the
drawbar for attachment to ordinary wagons
After a long and costly series of experiments the form of coupling shown
in illustration was adopted Part of the experimental couplings used
were made by the Hadfield Steel Foundry Company but the couplings used
at a recent trial at Gloucester were forged by the Gloucester Wagon
Company
Illustration AN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING
The trial couplings were applied to old and wornout coal wagons
varying in relative heights and widths of buffers and the tests were
1 Coupling and uncoupling and passing coupled round curves of less
than two chains radius 2 Coupling under rapid transit movement and
violent shock 3 Coupling under slow movement the wagons being shunted
together by two shunters 4 Wagons brought violently together while the
coupling hooks were lifted out of action to test the rigidity of the
hooks in this position 5 Tested in competition with the ordinary
coupling stock
The trial was a success The new automatic coupling satisfactorily
underwent the various conditions and it was proved that 1 It can be
lifted out of action with one hand and quite easily 2 It can be
coupled and uncoupled six times as fast as with the pole hook in the
daytime At night this advantage would be considerably increased
The coupling is strong as well as elastic in its parts and adjusts
itself to the various conditions of tractionEngineering

MAGAZINE RIFLES
ChaffeeReece Magazine RifleWe do not insert a drawing of this
armone of the three selected by the American boardas it belongs to
the same class and is similar in general construction to the Hotchkiss
There is however an important difference in the magazine which has no
spiral spring but is furnished instead with an ingenious system of
ratchet bars One of these carries forward the cartridge a distance
equal to its own length at each reciprocal motion of the bolt while a
second bar has no longitudinal motion but prevents the cartridges from
moving to the rear in the magazine tube after they have been moved
forward by the other bar The magazine is loaded through an aperture in
the butt plate the opening of the spring cover of which causes the two
ratchet bars to be depressed so that the magazine can be filled by
passing the cartridges along a smooth middle bar The act of closing the
spring cover again brings the two ratchet bars into play
Illustration FIG 9KROPATSCHEK MAGAZINE GUN
By means of a cutoff the ratchet bars can be prevented from acting and
the piece used as a single loader
Kropatschek Magazine RifleThis rifle which is the small arm of the
French navy has a boltaction rifle resembling the Gras see Fig 9
The magazine is a brass tube underneath the barrel as in the
Winchester Vetterli Mauser and other rifles of class 1 It contains
six cartridges while a seventh can be placed in the trough or carrier
T
When the breech is opened by pulling back the bolt a projection on the
latter strikes the carrier at N causing its front extremity to raise
the cartridge into the position shown in the section This movement is
accelerated by the spring A acting against a knifeedge projection on
the trough T in the upper position of the trough the spring acts upon
one face of the angle and upon the other face when in the lower
position
On closing the breech the bolt pushes the cartridge into the chamber
and when the handle is locked down to the right a part of the bolt
presses against a stud and thus depresses the trough to be ready to
receive another cartridge from the magazine
The magazine can be cut off and the rifle used as a single loader by
pushing forward a thumbpiece on the right side of the shoe The effect
of this is that on turning down the handle to lock the bolt the latter
does not act on the stud to depress the carrier so that no fresh
cartridges are fed up from the magazine
Illustration FIG 10LEE MAGAZINE GUN
There is a projection Z on the fore part of the carrier which keeps
the next cartridge from leaving the magazine while the trough is in the
upper or loading position A supplementary cartridge stop R pivoted at
P and having a spring L underneath it acts in conjunction with Z in
retaining the cartridges in the magazine and especially in preventing
more than one at a time from passing out into the carrier when the
latter is depressed it also retains the cartridges in the magazine tube
while the latter is being filled
Lee Magazine RifleThis arm see Fig 10 which occupied the place
of honor in the report of the American Board on Magazine Guns
embodied two new principles of considerable importance viz the
central position of the magazine and having it detachable with ease so
that two or more magazines can be carried by the soldier
The breech action of the Lee does not materially differ in design from
other bolt rifles except that the bolt is in two pieces onlythe body
or bolt proper and the hammer or cockingpiece The firing pin or
striker is screwed into the hammer the spiral main spring which
surrounds the striker is contained in a hollow in the body The handle
is placed at the rear end of the bolt and bent down toward the stock
so as to allow the trigger to be reached without wholly quitting hold of
the bolt The extractor is so connected with the bolt head as not to
share the rotation of the latter when the handle is turned down into the
locking position When the handle is turned up to unlock the bolt the
hammer is cammed slightly to the rear by means of oblique bearings on
the bolt and hammer so as to withdraw the point of the striker within
the face of the bolt This oblique cam action also gives great power to
the extractor at first starting the empty cartridge case out of the
chamber
The magazine M is simply a sheet iron or steel box of a size to hold
five cartridges but there seems no reason why it should not be of
larger dimensions It is detachable from the rifle and is inserted from
underneath into a slot or mortise in the stock and in the shoe in front
of the trigger guard A magazine catch C just above the trigger guard
engages in a notch N in the rear of the magazine the projection L
first entering a recess prepared for it in the shoe There is a magazine
spring D at the bottom of the magazine box which pushes the cartridges
up into the shoe The point of the top cartridge is pushed into the
projection L and this keeps the lower cartridges in their places in
the box while the latter is detached when the magazine is inserted in
the rifle the withdrawal of the bolt causes the top cartridge to be
slightly drawn back so that it is now free to be fed up into the shoe
by the magazine spring D
There is a later pattern of magazine which has its front face quite
plain with no projection L as the magazine catch was found sufficient
to hold the box in its place To prevent the cartridges being pressed
out of the magazine before the latter is inserted in the rifle there is
a strong spring placed vertically in one side of this box the curved
upper end of which bears upon the top cartridge when the magazine is in
its place in the shoe this side spring is so acted upon that it ceases
to hold down the cartridges in the box
To use the rifle as a single loader formerly the magazine had to be
detached when a spring plate in the shoe which is pushed aside by the
insertion of the magazine starts back into its place and nearly fills
the magazine slot so as to prevent cartridges falling through to the
ground when fed into the chamber by hand The later pattern however
has two notches on the magazine for the catch C to engage in When the
magazine is inserted in the slot only as far as the upper notch the
rifle can be used only as a single loader but on pressing the box home
to the second notch the magazine immediately comes into play
The magazine can be released from the slot by an upward pressure on the
lower projecting end of the magazine catch C which is covered by the
trigger guard
Improved LeeThis rifle is precisely similar in principle to the
Lee the chief difference being that the magazine is permanently fixed
in its slot underneath the shoe and in front of the trigger guard The
cartridges are inserted from above There is a stop by means of which
the cartridges can be prevented rising up into the shoe and which forms
a sort of false bottom to the slot in the latter so that the arm can be
used as a single loader
LeeBurtonThe bolt action is the same as the Lee but the box
magazine is attached to the right side of the shoe instead of being
underneath as in that rifle When the magazine is raised to its higher
position the cartridges pass successively into the shoe by the action
