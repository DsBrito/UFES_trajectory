Chapter 1
A FORESHADOWING
THE Patriarch of Alexandria Egypt was expecting company He stood at
the window of his palace looking down the long road that at the first
sign of his guests arrival he might go forth and welcome them Before
him like a white pearl in the blue waters of the Mediterranean lay
the city of Alexandriathe beautiful as men loved to call it
Across the harbor the marble tower of the great lighthouse soared up
into the clear Eastern sky white as the white cliffs of the Island of
Pharos from which it sprang It was noonday and the sunshine lay like
a veil of gold over all
The Patriarchs thoughts were wandering in the past He had been
celebrating the anniversary of his holy predecessor Peter the
previous Bishop who had won the crown of martyrdom during the
terrible persecution of the Christians not so many years before
Several of the clergy present had come from afar to assist at the
festival and these were to be his expected guests
The time of suffering was past and over and yet it seemed to
Alexander as if it had all happened yesterday and might happen again
tomorrow There stood the great palace of the Caesars where the pagan
emperor had sat in judgment upon the lambs of Christs flock there
the famous temple of Serapis where the Christians had been dragged to
offer incense to the gods there the amphitheater where they had been
torn to pieces by beasts and slain with the sword for confessing the
Name of Christ And all through those dark days firm and steadfast as
the lighthouse on the cliffs of Pharos had stood the Patriarch Peter
a tower of strength and comfort to his persecuted children
A hundred Bishops and more had looked to him as their head for the
See of Alexandria in the East was second only to that of Rome in the
West and the burden of responsibility was heavy But thanks to the
example of its chief the Church in Egypt had borne the trial bravely
and if some had quailed before the torture and the rack and had fallen
away by far the greater number had been true Even the unheroic
souls who had loved their lives better than their God had not been
lost beyond hope for they had come back during the lulls in the
storm begging to be absolved from their sin And Peter mindful of
his Masters words that he should not quench the smoking flax nor
break the bruised reed received them back after they had done
penance into the fold of Christ with mercy and compassion
There were some who had not scrupled to protest against such mercy
Were these apostates cried Meletius Bishop of Lykopolis to be
made equal to those who had borne the burden and the heat of the day
And he had rebelled against the decision of the Patriarch and made a
schism in the Church Even the martyrdom of the holy Peter had not
brought him back to his allegiance the Meletians were rebels still
to the crying scandal of Christians and pagans alike
They were a hard people to govern these Alexandrianssubtle
passionate and unstable ready to follow any preacher of novelties
Alexander half envied Peter his martyrs crown as he stood musing over
the past
What was delaying his guests he wondered as he looked down the long
road where there was as yet no sign of them
On the shore at a little distance a group of boys were playing
their bare legs and white tunics flashing hither and thither as they
ran One of them a tall slim lad whose aureole of ruddy hair seemed
to catch every wandering sunbeam was evidently directing the game
for all seemed to look to him for orders A leader of men smiled
the Patriarch to himself as a vigorous wave of the boys hand brought
all his companions round him
They were building some kind of a platform now on to which he of the
ruddy locks was promptly hoisted while the others appeared to be
forming a procession
A church ceremony murmured the Patriarch to himself remembering
his own boyhood days Presently a little boy advanced solemnly and
presented some kind of a vessel to the youthful bishop who with a
magnificent gesture beckoned to the procession to approach Then as
the foremost boy advanced and knelt at his feet he raised the vessel
and poured some of its contents over his head
The baptism of the catechumens exclaimed the Patriarch but this
looks a good deal too much like earnest
Hastily calling a servant he bade him go down to the shore and bring
up the band of boys who were playing there Summoned thus hastily to
appear before authority they approached with some uneasiness and
there was a certain amount of scuffling among them which resulted in
the appearance of the wouldbe bishop in the forefront of the
groupand where should a bishop be if not at the head of his flock
What were you doing down there on the shore asked the Patriarch
The boys clear eyes looked at him with interest but without a
vestige of fear
We were playing he said It was the baptism of the catechumens I
was the bishop and theypointing to his companionswere the
catechumens
Are you a Christian asked Alexander
Yes answered the boy proudly
And these
Catechumens
What did you do
I poured the water on them and said the words
What words
The boy repeated the formula in perfect Greek
Did you pour the water as you said the words
Yes
The Patriarchs face was troubled
It is a dangerous game to play at he said What would you say if I
told you that you had really baptized them
The boy looked at him in amazement
But I am not a bishop he said
The Patriarch could not help smiling
Although the bishop usually does baptize the catechumens he said
it is not necessary that it should be a bishop not even necessary
that it should be a priest
The boybishop looked grave his companions frightened the Patriarch
thoughtful
What is your name he asked suddenly laying his hand on the ruddy
locks
Athanasius answered the boy
What would you like to be he asked
A priest was the prompt answer
A bishop perhaps asked Alexander with a smile you think it is an
easy and a glorious life
The boys eyes looked straight into the Patriarchs
The blessed Peter was a martyr he answered
You need much learning to be a priest
I love learning said the boy
Alexander noted the broad intelligent brow the keen eyes and the
clearcut face before him His heart went out to this frank and
fearless lad who loved the martyrs
Come to me this evening and we will talk of this he said for his
guests were at last to be seen approaching and his duty lay with
them
That evening the boy and the Patriarch had much to say to each other
as they walked under the palm trees in the garden of the episcopal
palace Alexander learned how Athanasius had been brought up in the
Christian Faith under the shadow of the great persecution among those
who counted it the highest honor to shed their blood for Christ He
had been well taught in the famous Greek schools of Alexandria and was
full of enthusiasm for the great Greek philosophers and poets Strong
of will noble of heart and keen of intellect the boy was born to
something greatof that the Patriarch felt assured The Church had
need of such men in these troublous times when the dangers of heresy
had succeeded to those of persecution
Alexander at once resolved to take Athanasius into his household and
to bring him up as his own son an inspiration for which he was often
to thank God in the years to come The boy soon grew to love the
gentle and holy Patriarch who could act with such strength and
decision when it was needful for the good of the Church He was
constantly in touch with men of every rank and country for Alexandria
was a city where people of all nations and of all creeds met Pagans
Jews and Christians lived side by side in their various quarters
there even existed a set of philosophers who tried to make a religion
for themselves out of an amalgamation of several others
Athanasius was still very young when he began to act as secretary to
the Patriarch accompanying him on all his journeys throughout his
vast diocese and he himself tells us how he stayed for a time among
the monks in the desert of Egypt and how his young soul was set on
fire by the holiness of their lives
Neither science nor logic nor philosophy offered any difficulty to the
brilliant young scholar whose knowledge of Scripture and of theology
was to astonish the men of his time Alexander himself as he grew
older leaned more and more on Athanasius consulting him young as he
was on the most important matters So the years rolled on and the
boy grew into manhood gentle and strong as we are told by one who
knew him high in prowess humble in spirit full of sympathy
angelic in mind and face That he would make his mark on the world of
his time few who knew him doubted but of the dauntless
soldierspirit that slumbered behind that gentle mien of the
steadfast will that no human power could shake they knew but little
Gods moment had not yet come
Chapter 2
ARIUS THE HERESIARCH
THE night before the martyrdom of the Patriarch Peter as he had lain
in prison praying and waiting for that dawn which was to be his last
on earth there had come to him a few of his faithful clergy They had
braved many dangers to look once more upon the face of their beloved
Bishop and to obtain his blessing and his last instructions they had
come also to plead for one who had asked their help
But a short time before a certain man called Arius had been
excommunicated by the Patriarch for having joined the schism of
Meletius He it was who that very day had visited them beseeching
them with tears to use their influence with Peter to obtain his
pardon The clerics knew the tenderness of their Bishops heart and
his readiness to forgive the erring they were therefore greatly
surprised when their petition met with a stern refusal
Never said Peter Arius is separated from the glory of the Son of
God both in this world and in the next
Then as Achillas and Alexander his dearest and most intimate
friends had drawn him apart to ask the reason for such unusual
severity
This night he said as I prayed Our Lord appeared to me in glory
but His robe was rent from top to bottom Who has treated Thee thus
my Lord I cried and rent Thy garments
It is Arius He replied who has torn My robe and tomorrow they
will come to you to intercede for him Therefore I have warned you to
keep him from the fold But you shall die for Me tomorrow
Then Achillas and Alexander and they that were with them prayed once
more with their Bishop and he blessed them and bade them depart in
peace And when the morning came the promise of Christ was fulfilled
and His faithfu1 servant received the martyrs crown
Achillas succeeded Peter as Patriarch and in course of time yielding
to the entreaties of Arius and deceived by his apparent good faith he
received him back into the fold and gave him charge of one of the
largest churches in Alexandria in a district called Baukalis
Tall and striking in appearance with a certain eloquence and a great
pretense of holiness Arius soon became a popular preacher He had
even hoped it was said to succeed Achillas as Patriarch and when
on the death of Achillas Alexander was elected to take his place
Arius anger and envy knew no bounds Since he could find no fault
with the conduct of the new Patriarch whom everyone acknowledged to
be blameless and holy he proceeded to find fault with his doctrine
In teaching that Christ was the Eternal Son of God said the priest
of Baukalis Alexander and his clergy made a great mistake Since
Christ was the creation of God the Father how could He Himself be
God
It was a heresy that struck at the very roots of Christianity
Alexander remembered too late the warning of Peter Gentle and
peaceful by nature he tried at first to win Arius by kindness Let
him explain his difficulty he said and discuss the question with
theologians but all such suggestions were met with pride and
obstinacy Arius at last sent a haughty statement of his opinions
which were condemned by nearly all the Bishops of Egypt He was
therefore deposed and forbidden to preach but he was not the man to
take his defeat humbly
Hastening to Caesarea in Palestine where he had influential friends
he gave himself out as the very famous the much suffering for Gods
glory who taught of God has acquired wisdom and knowledge Many
were seduced by his insidious persuasions among them Eusebius the
Bishop of Caesarea in Palestine who thoroughly taken in by the
deceits and false holiness of the heretic wrote a letter to Alexander
in his favor
The Patriarch replied by a detailed account of Arius teaching and his
trial giving the reasons why the Synod had thought fit to depose him
This letter had an effect on the clergy and Bishops of Palestine which
Arius was quick enough to see He therefore retired into Syria where
he made great friends with another Eusebius the clever and crafty
Bishop of Nicomedia who had gained an unfortunate influence over the
Emperor
It was now nearly twelve years since Constantine himself a pagan
though the son of St Helena had prayed to the God of the Christians
to give him the victory over his enemies His prayers had been heard
In the brightness of the noonday sky there appeared a sign which
outshone the sun in splendorthe image of the Cross of Christ In
this sign thou shalt conquer was traced in fiery letters across it
and the Emperor and all his army saw and believed
With the Cross as standard Constantine marched against his enemies
and defeated them From that day forth he became a catechumen and the
protector and friend of the Christians His first act was to publish
an edict the Edict of Milan which gave them full liberty to practice
their religion build churches and preach Thus the Church came forth
at last from the dark night of persecution but her life on earth is
ever a warfare against the powers of evil and other dangers lay
ahead
The Emperor began by making humane laws He abolished the punishment
of crucifixion out of reverence for the Son of God who had died upon
the Cross put a stop to the cruel games of the arena and bettered the
condition of the slaves
Constantines nature was really a noble one but there was much in him
still of the pagan and the barbarian Unfortunately for himself and
for the world he fell under the influence of Eusebius Bishop of
Nicomedia
This man who was said to have apostatized during the persecution of
Maxentius and who had intruded himself no one quite knew how into
the See of Nicomedia had begun by winning the good graces of
Constantia the Emperors sister During the time when Constantias
husband Licinius was at war with her brother Eusebius was his
staunch friend upholding him in his rebellion against the Emperor
but on the defeat of Licinius the Bishop at once transferred his
friendship to the conqueror Constantine Bishop Eusebius resembled
Arius in his want of reverence and of honesty and had taken Arius
side against the Patriarch Alexander praising openly the teaching of
Arius and declaring that his only wish was that all men should share
his opinions He had even dared to write in Arius favor to the
Patriarch declaring insolently that he had been unjustly deposed
Alexander was growing old but the Faith was in peril it was a moment
for vigorous action Moreover at his side like a faithful watchdog
stood his secretary the young deacon Athanasius Circular letters
were sent to Pope St Sylvester and to all the Bishops warning them of
the new danger that was threatening the Church Since Eusebius has
placed himself at the head of these apostates wrote Alexander it
is necessary that it should be made known to all the faithful lest
they should be deceived by their hypocrisy
Eusebius and Arius were both astonished and disgusted at the firm
attitude of the Patriarch Athanasius was at the bottom of it they
declared and they vowed an undying hatred against him The Emperor
Constantine who happened at this moment to be visiting Nicomedia
where he had spent a great part of his youth heard Eusebius version
of the story It was only a question of words said the wily Bishop
what was really distressing about it was the spite and the venom with
which the Patriarch of Alexandria had pursued an innocent and holy man
for having dared to differ from him in opinion Arius was then
presented to the Emperor as a faithful and unjustly persecuted priest
a part which he knew how to play to perfection
It was well known to Eusebius that the great desire of Constantine was
to preserve and maintain peace in his empire If this quarrel were
allowed to go on said the Bishop there would soon be strife
throughout the whole of the East for there was much bitterness
already On the other hand Constantine was known to all Christians as
the protector and generous benefactor of the Church Would it not be
well for him suggested Eusebius to use his influence for good and to
write to Alexander bidding him lay aside this most unchristian
dispute and make peace with Arius and his followers The Emperor as
Eusebius had hoped took alarm at the prospect of disunion in his
dominions A catechumen himself and knowing but little of the great
truths of Christianity he was easily deceived by Eusebius story and
hastened to take his advice
It was a scandalous thing he wrote that the peace of the Church
should be disturbed for such a trivial matter Let Alexander and Arius
forgive one another let them each keep their own opinion if they
chose but in concord and in quiet He ended by begging both to give
him peace by making peace among themselves and by putting an end to
all such quarrels
The letter was entrusted to Hosius Bishop of Cordova a confessor of
the Faith venerated throughout the Church for his wisdom and
holiness He was to deliver it personally to the Patriarch of
Alexandria
Now Hosius was a Bishop of the Western Church and had heard but vague
rumors of the doings of Arius and his followers in the East His first
interview with the Patriarch of Alexandria opened his eyes to the
importance of the matter It was no question of a war of words or a
difference of opinionChristianity itself was at stake the Emperor
must be warned and warned at once A letter was therefore written by
the two Bishops assisted probably by Athanasius in which the Emperor
was earnestly begged to take steps to summon a universal Council of
the Church to decide the question It was dispatched to him by a
trusty messenger and in due time reached his hands
Constantine who was really anxious to do what was right appealed to
the Pope St Sylvester to unite with him in summoning a Council To
the Bishops who were too poor to undertake a long journey with the
usual attendance of clergy the Emperor offered the necessary means
He undertook also to house and provide for the members of the Council
as long as it lasted The town of Nicea in Bithynia about twenty
miles from Nicomedia was chosen as the meeting place It was hoped by
all devout Christians that peace and unity in the Church would be the
result
Chapter 3
THE GREAT COUNCIL
IN the early summer of the year 325 the Council of Nicea met Three
hundred eighteen Bishops were present besides a multitude of priests
deacons and acolytes It was like the Day of Pentecost said the
people men of all nations and of all tongues
Many bore the glorious marks of the sufferings they had endured for
Christ others were wasted with long years of prison There were the
hermit Bishops of Egypt Paphnutius and Potamon who had each lost an
eye for the Faith Paul of NeoCaesarea whose muscles had been burned
with redhot irons and whose paralyzed hands bore witness to the fact
Cecilian of Carthage intrepid and faithful guardian of his flock
James of Nisibis who had lived for years in the desert in caves and
mountains Spyridion the shepherd Bishop of Cyprus and the great St
Nicholas of Myra both famed for their miracles
Among the Bishops of the West were Theophilus the Goth goldenhaired
and ruddy who had won thousands to the Faith and Hosius the
Spaniard known as the holy who had been named by the Pope as his
representative together with the two Papal Legates Vito and Vincent
Among those of the Eastern Church were the venerable St Macarius
Bishop of Jerusalem and St Amphion who had been put to the torture
in the reign of Diocletian
Last but not least came the aged Patriarch of Alexandria the chief
prelate of the Eastern Church who had brought with him as his
assistant the young deacon Athanasius
Of the 318 Bishops present seventeen headed by Eusebius of
Nicomedia were in sympathy with Arius They were but a small number
it is true yet Eusebius was the adviser of Constantine and the friend
of his sister Constantia He relied on his influence with the Emperor
and his wellknown powers of persuasion
The day has come for the opening of the Council The Bishops and
clergy are assembled in a great hall which has been prepared for this
purpose In the center upon a splendid throne lies a copy of the
Four Gospels symbol of the presence of Christ in the midst of His
Church At the upper end a small gilt throne has been erected for the
Emperor while the Bishops and the clergy sit on seats and benches
running the whole way around the hall
A quick whisper suddenly breaks the silence The Emperor and the
whole assembly rises to its feet Few of those present have seen the
man whose name is on every lip a Caesar and a Christian
Alone and unattended with bent head and humble mien the Emperor
crosses the threshold A man of noble presence and of royal dignity
he wears the robe of Imperial purple blazing with gold and precious
stones the Imperial crown is on his head There are some there who
have seen that Imperial purple before but under what different
circumstancesHail Caesar those about to die salute thee
He advances slowly and with faltering footsteps between the ranks of
Bishops standing to do him honor Constantine the Great the conqueror
of the Roman world trembles in the presence of these intrepid
Confessors of the Faith who bear upon them the marks of the conflict
In the midst of that august assembly he the catechumen is as a
little child He will not even take his seat upon the throne prepared
for him until the Bishops urge him to do so
The Emperor speaks to them with deference and courtesy It is not for
him he says to dictate to them for here he is but fellow servant
with them of a glorious Lord and Master They had met to preserve
peace and concord in the Church and to put an end to all causes of
strife Let them do what they can to that end
There are two men in that assembly on whom all eyes are bent One of
them is about sixty years of age tall thin and poorly clad as one
who leads an austere life A wild shock of hair overshadows his face
which is of a deathly pallor his eyes are usually downcast owing to
a weakness of sight He has a curious way of writhing when he speaks
which his enemies compare to the wriggling of a snake He is given to
fits of frenzy and wild excitement but has withal when he chooses a
most winning and earnest manner fascinating to men and women
alikeArius the heresiarch
The other seated on a low seat beside the Patriarch of Alexandria is
slight fair and young only his broad brow and keen earnest eyes
betray something of the spirit within he shows no excitement Serene
and watchful silent yet quick in his movements he is like a young
St Michael leaning on his sword ready to strike for the truth when
the moment shall comeAthanasius the deacon
The heresiarch is called upon to explain his doctrines His discourse
is long and eloquent He uses to the utmost his powers of fascination
He tries to hide the full meaning of his words under beautiful
expressions but his meaning is clear to allJesus Christ is not
God
The Fathers and Confessors of the Faith stricken with horror at the
blasphemy cry out and stop their ears The indignation is universal
Eusebius and his party are in consternation Arius has been too
outspoken He has stated his opinions too crudely such frankness will
not do here he is no longer among the ignorant Eusebius himself
rises to speak and with the insinuating and charming manner for which
he is famous tries to gloss over what Arius has said
The Son of God is infinitely holy he says the holiest of all the
creations of the Father and far above them all Very very close to
the Father Himself so close that He is very nearly God As a matter
of fact he declares the Arians believe all that the Church teaches
A letter is produced and read by one of the prelates it was written
by Eusebius himself to a friend Full of heresy it shows most clearly
the doubledealing of the Arian Bishop and his party The indignation
breaks out afresh and the letter is torn to shreds in the presence of
the Council Even Eusebius is abashed but there are others to take
his place The Arians continue the argument
Silent and watchful at his post sits the young man who is destined to
be the champion of the Faith through all the troublous years to come
He has not spoken yet but now Alexander makes him a sign The sword
flashes from its scabbard woe to those on whom its blows shall fall
In a few words sharp and clear as diamonds Athanasius tears to
pieces the veils in which the Arians had shrouded their true meaning
Who has deceived you O senseless he asks to call the Creator a
creature
He is the champion of Christ the champion of the truth The Bishops
marvel at his words which are as of one inspired they thank God who
has raised up so strong a bulwark against error Alexanders eyes are
aglow it is for this that he has lived he knew how it would be His
long lifes work is nearly at an end he can go now in peace
Athanasius is at his post
But it is time to put an end to the discussion Arius and his opinions
are abhorred by everyone A profession of Faith is drawn up by Hosius
the representative of Pope St Sylvester and presented for all to
sign It establishes forever the Godhead of Christ To this day it is
the profession of Faith of the whole Catholic worldthe Nicene Creed
Born of the Father before all ages God of God Light of Light
true God of true God begotten not made consubstantial with the
Father
The Emperor has listened earnestly to the discussion following it as
well as he can with his limited knowledge of doctrine He approves the
profession of Faith with his whole heart let it be presented to all
to sign
But firstone momentthis heresy must be stamped out once and
forever or there will be trouble in the days to come An addition must
be made before the signatures are affixed It runs thus And if any
say There was a time when God was not or if any hold that the Son
is not of the same substance with the Father or is    like a
created being the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church condemns him as it
condemns forever Arius and his writings
The text is then presented to the Bishops to sign All are content but
the seventeen Arians The Emperor expresses his entire satisfaction
with the decisions of the Council he will uphold the law of the
Church with the law of the State he declares and those who rebel
will be punished
The ranks of the Arians begin to waver several Bishops sign the
Creed soon there are only five leftEusebius at their head
The Emperor speaks of banishment
The argument is a powerful one Eusebius wavers He receives a message
from Constantia bidding him give way resistance is useless He signs
the profession in company with Theognis of Nicea his friend
Arius with several of his supporters is then condemned to
banishment and his writings are to be burned publicly The minds of
all are at rest Several other matters of less importance are settled
satisfactorily The Council is at an end
But Constantine has not finished with the Bishops Today begins the
twentieth year of his reign a day kept with great rejoicing by the
Roman Emperors A banquet has been prepared at the palace he claims
the honor of entertaining the Confessors and Fathers of the Faith
Times have changed indeed The soldiers of the Imperial Guard salute
with drawn swords the guests of the Emperor as they pass between them
into the palacethat Imperial Guard who in other days which many
there remember had dragged the Christians to torture and to death
The Emperor receives them with veneration kissing devoutly the scars
of those who have suffered for the Faith The banquet over he begs
their prayers and loads them with gifts giving to each of the Bishops
a letter to the governor of his province ordering a distribution of
wheat to the churches for the use of the poor
The hearts of all are full of joy and thankfulness Taking leave of
the Emperor they return each man to his own country The Council of
Nicea is over
But there were two in whose hearts there was neither joy nor peace nor
thankfulness they were Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis of Nicea
Were they to return to their sees and confess themselves beaten It
would be a bitter homecoming The officials of the palace were well
known to Eusebius He bribed the librarian to let him see once more
the famous document that had just been signed by so many Bishops
Then seizing a moment when the guardians back was turned the two
Arians deleted their names from the profession of Faith and returning
home continued to teach the doctrines which the Church had condemned
They counted on the protection of Constantia and her influence with
the Emperor but they were mistaken
Three months after the Council of Nicea Eusebius and Theognis were
deposed by Alexander and the Bishops of Egypt who elected Catholic
prelates in their stead The Emperor supported the decision of the
Church pronouncing a sentence of banishment on the rebels Eusebius
